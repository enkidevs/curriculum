## Content

 `#` doesn't mark the beginning of a comment in none of the examples. In the first case, it will trigger a base 10 conversion of the binary `1001`, echoing 9. On the second line `#` is escaped, losing its special meaning. The third echo will print the length of the variable, which is 6. Lastly, double `##` is short-hand for stripping the longest substring of `name` matching the expression 'Jo', outputting `hnny`.
