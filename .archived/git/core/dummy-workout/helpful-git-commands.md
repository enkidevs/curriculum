# Helpful Git Commands

## Content

Among the possible answers, `repack` is the only command not recognized by `git`:
- `reflog` is a local record of all commits referenced in your repository, and can be seen as a “saftey net”, useful for recovering lost commits.
- `request-pull` prints in the standard output a report asking the upstream project to `pull` changes into their tree.
- `merge-base` finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits to use in a three-way merge.
