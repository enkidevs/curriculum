# How to set your username and email


---

## Content

You must set your **username** and **email address** when you first start using git.

```bash
git config --global 
  user.name "C Mustard"
git config --global 
  user.email me@enki.com
```

Every time you make a commit, git adds your username and email to the commit. This is so the other people working on the project will know that you have made those changes.

## Practice

Set your username :

```bash
git ??? ??? 
      ??? 'my username'
```

- config
- --global

## Revision
