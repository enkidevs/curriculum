Make sure you end your constants in `f` to make gcc store them as floats.
```
  float val = someFloat * 2.2f;
```
This is mostly important when someFloat may actually be a double, you don't need the mixed-mode math, since you're losing precision in 'val' on storage. 

While floating-point numbers are supported in hardware on iPhones, it may still take more time to do double-precision arithmetic as opposed to single precision.
