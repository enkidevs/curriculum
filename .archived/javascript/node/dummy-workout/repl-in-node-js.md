## Content

In Node.js you can use a **Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)** to interactively run JavaScript and print the results. You can use this for debugging, testing, or experimenting with your code.

You can access the REPL by executing `node` without any arguments from the command-line:

```
$ node
>
```
You can now type in and run JavaScript commands, for example:
```
> console.log('Hello!');
Hello!
```

The Node REPL has similar controls to most consoles/shells. You can press _tab_ to autocomplete variables and use the up and down _arrow keys_ to scroll through your previous commands.
