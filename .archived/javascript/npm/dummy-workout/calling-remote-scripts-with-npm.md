# Calling remote scripts with npm

---
## Content

Scripting can be specified in the `package.json` file under the `scripts` field.

 `npm` provides users the ability to call out to a bash or command file:
```json
{
  //fields
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:complex" : "./myScript.sh"
  },
  //fields
}
```

Using this practice requires that the user has **permission** for executing the specified script.

It's not recommended or good practice to use this when it's unnecessary as this will hide some functionality of the script.

## Practice

Scripting can be specified in the ??? under the ??? field.

* package.json
* scripts
* README.md
* dependencies
* scripting
* secrets

## Revision

Complete the `package.json` in order to make the script `deploy` call the remote script `myDeploy.sh`:
```json
{
  //fields
  "???": {
    "???" : "./myDeploy.sh"
  },
  //fields
}
```

* script
* deploy
* run
* resume
* remote
* call
