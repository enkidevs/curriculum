# Current Lifecycle Event

---
## Content

`npm` provides an environment variable called `npm_lifecycle_event` which is set to whichever stage of the cycle is being executed.

Considering the scenario:
```
{ "scripts" :
  { "install" : "enki/install.js"
  , "postinstall" : "enki/install.js"
  , "uninstall" : "enki/uninstall.js"
  }
}
```
`enki/install.js` will be called for both de install and post-install stages of the lifecycle. 

Using:
```javascript
process.env.npm_lifecycle_event
```

you can check on which stage you are on so conditional implementation on the same script can be easily achieved.
