# Hook scripts!

---
## Content

`npm` is aware of some **script names** that will be ran automatically in the lifecycle if they're defined:
-  `publish`
- `install`
- `uninstall`
- `version`
- `test`
- `start`
- `stop` 
- `restart` 

Every one of these have respective `post<name>` and `pre<name>` hooks (e.g. `preinstall` and `postinstall`). 


Executable files are placed at:
```
node_modules/.hooks/{eventname}
```
These will be ran for **all packages** so this is useful when you want to run the same scripts for multiple packages during their lifecycle.

These hook scripts run in the same way as a normal script specified in `package.json`, but in *separate child processes*.

## Practice

Executable files are placed at:

```
node_modules/.hooks/{eventname} 
```
These will be ran in the same way as a normal script specified in `package.json` but in separate ???.

* child processes
* worker processes
* functions
* processes
