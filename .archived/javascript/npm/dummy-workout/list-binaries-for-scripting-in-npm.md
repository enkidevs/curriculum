# List binaries for scripting in npm

---
## Content

Multiple packages installed through `npm` have binaries that let the user run them directly from the command line.

A clear example is `nodemon` package that, after installation, lets the user use the `nodemon` command.

These binaries can also be used when defining and writing scripts inside `package.json` file.

As `npm` will add these binaries to the `./node_modules/.bin/` folder, you can list
files in this folder to see what binaries you can use.
```bash
$ ls ./node_modules/.bin/
_mocha    jslint    nodemon
coffee    mocha     tsc
```

---
## Practice

List the files in the folder to see what binaries you can use:
```
$ ??? ./???/???/
```

* ls
* node_modules
* .bin
* bin
* binaries
* script
* print

---
## Revision

List all binaries used for scripting installed through `npm`:
```bash
$ ??? ./node_modules/???/
```

* ls
* .bin
* bin
* binaries
* script
* print
