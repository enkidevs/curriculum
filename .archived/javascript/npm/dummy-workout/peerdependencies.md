# `peerDependencies`

---
## Content

In some scenarios, a library may be needed to express the *compatibility* of your package, without necessarily needing a `require` of the plugin. 

Just as well, your module may expose a specific interface, expected and specified by the library.

The `package.json` file has the `peerDependencies` object that fits these exact needs:
```javascript
{  "name": "my-module",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "peerDepedencies": {
      "needed-plugin": "3.x"
   }
}
        
```

This practice will ensure that your package can be installed along with the host package. `npm install my-module` can yield the dependency graph:
```
|-- my-module@1.0.0
â””-- needed-plugin@3.3.0
```

In version 1 and 2 of `npm` , `peerDependencies` are installed automatically. In the latest version (3), a warning message is displayed if the peer dependencies are not installed.

## Revision

Complete `package.json` for your app to support `enki@1.0.0` as a peer dependency:
```json
{ "???": {
     "enki": "1.0.0"
   }
}
```
