# Publishing with npm

---
## Content

Publishing packages to the `npm` registry is done via the `npm publish` command.
The package will contain all the files in a specified folder that are not included in either `.gitignore` nor `.npmignore` files.

Sample publishing:
```bash
npm publish myFolder
```

Instead of the folder specified (which must include the `package.json` file) a **tarball** URL or file can be passed as argument.

Specifying tags for the version published is done via the `--tag` flag:
```bash
npm publish myFolder --tag=myTag
```
To install the version with `myTag`:
```bash
npm install myFolder@myTag
```
Premium npm users can publish private packages with `--access` tag:
```bash
npm publish myFolder --access=restricted
```

Note that once a package is published with a given name and version, the name/version combination cannot be used ever again even if the package is `unpublished`.
