# Scoped packages

---
## Content

Since *npm* started supporting scoping, multiple packages can have the same name while they are under a different **scope** (that acts like a namespace).

The naming convention for scopes is the same as with package names: **url-safe characters**, **no leading dots or underscores**. Scopes are prefixed by the `@` symbol, followed by a `/` and the whole construct precedes the package name:
```javascript
@myscope/mypackagename
```

This syntax must be used when trying to `install` a package or specify a package in *package.json*:
```bash
$ npm install @myscope/mypackagename
```
```json
//package.json
"dependencies: {
  "@myscope/mypackagename: "~1.3.3"
}
```
To initialise a scoped package, the scope must be specified in the package name:
```json
{
  "name": "@myscope/myprojectname"
}
```
`--scope` flag for `npm init` also works:
```bash
$ npm init -scope=myscope
```
To use a scoped package you need to `require` it using the scoped name:
```js
var scopedPackage =
  require('@myscope/somePackage');

```
