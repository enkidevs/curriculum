# Tab completion in `npm`

---
## Content

**Tab-completion** can help you speed up typing commands in any command-line environments. You can also enable tab completion for `npm` commands as well as scripts defined in the `package.json` file.

```bash
$ npm completion >> tabCompletion.sh
```
This will create a `.sh` file that enables tab completion for the `package.json` file in the current directory.
You need to load this file into the current *shell*.

Instead of creating a separate file, the tab completion script can be sent to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` files to enable tab completion for every new terminal window:
```bash
$ npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
```
