# View specific fields of npm packages

---
## Content

The `npm view` command will print by default to `stdout` data about specified packages.

Get the package **registry entry** of a published package:
```bash
npm view enki
```
Without specifying, the output will reflect data from the *latest version* of the package. However, version can also be specified.

Get dependencies of a specific version:
```bash
npm view enki@1.3.4 dependencies
``` 

Get the git repository URL:
```bash
npm view enki repository.url
```
Multiple fields can be specified:
```bash
npm view enki contributors.name \n
  contributors.email
```

To output object in **JSON** format instead of JavaScript object literal, the `--json` flag can be used.
