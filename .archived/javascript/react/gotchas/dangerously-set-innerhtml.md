# Dangerously set `innerHTML`

---
## Content

React gives you the ability to insert *raw* HTML.

Take into  consideration that this practice is definitely to be avoided because it makes your code vulnerable to *cross-site scripting* (XSS).

 React named the prop which is used to pass this data as `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. A key is used to specify the text with `__html`:
```
dangerouslySetInnerHTML:
{ __html: '<p>My HTML text </p>' }
```
The recommended way of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when needed is by creating an object containing only the key `__html` and your *sanitized* data as the value.
```
function createMarkup()
{ return {__html: '<p>My HTML text </p>'};};
```

This method will prevent incorrect rendering.

## Practice

Fill the key needed for the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop:
```javascript
dangerouslySetInnerHTML:
{ ???: '<p>Enki </p>' }
```


* `__html`
* `html`
* `_html`
* `value`
* `id`
* `text`
