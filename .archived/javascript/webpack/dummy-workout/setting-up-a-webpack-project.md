# Setting up a Webpack project

---
## Content

To install Webpack:
```bash
npm i webpack --save-dev
```

Set up a directory structure as follows:
```bash
/app
  - main.js
  - component.js
/build
  - bundle.js (created automatically)
  - index.html
package.json
webpack.config.js
```

Once some functionality has been added to the *`app/component.js`* and *`app/main.js`*, `webpack` can be run in the terminal and the application will be built.

A *`bundle.js`* file will appear in your */build* folder. 

The application can be opened by double clicking the *index.html* file.
