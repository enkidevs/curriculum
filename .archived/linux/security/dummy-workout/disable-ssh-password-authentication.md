# Disable SSH password authentication 

---
## Content

To combat *brute force* attacks, it is possible to disable password authentication.

First, allow log-in by certificate. 
Copy the contents of your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server:

```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | 
    ssh user@hostname 'cat >> 
       ~/.ssh/authorized_keys &&
       chmod 700 ~/.ssh/ &&
       chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

```

Then, open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and find: 

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Change it to: 

```
PasswordAuthentication no
``` 

Restart the `SSH` server daemon to apply the change:
```
$ sudo service ssh restart
```

Now it is only possible to `SSH` into the server using a key that matches a line in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. 

Brute force attacks are no longer effective because even a correct password guess will be rejected.

???. 
* to ease logging in from multiple machines
* to combat brute force attacks
* to ensure you are the only one who can log
