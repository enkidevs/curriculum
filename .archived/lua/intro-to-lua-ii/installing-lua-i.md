## Content

Now hold your horses! Before you can start coding in Lua, **you need a way to code and test Lua**.

Traditionally, many languages require IDEs[1] and a text editor, but for this course, coding on **an online IDE is perfectly fine**! You can view online demo programs [here](https://www.lua.org/demo.html).
