# IO Write

---
## Content

In Lua, the `io.write()` function is used to **write to a file or the standard output**. It takes one or more arguments and writes them to the output stream. The function returns `nil` on success or an error message on failure.

Here's an example that uses `io.write()` to write to the standard output:
```lua
-- Write a string to the standard output
io.write("Hello, world!\n")

-- Write multiple values to the standard output
io.write("The answer is: ", 42, "\n")
```

---
## Practice

Output "Hello, world!" using the appropriate `io` function. Also, add a new line after the message using the escape sequence.
```lua
io.???("Hello, world!???")
```

- write
- \n
- print
- newLine
