# I/O Lines

---
## Content

The `io.lines` function is a convenient way to **read a file line by line**. 

It **returns an iterator** that can be **used in a `for` loop** to read the file line by line. 

Each iteration of the loop **returns the next line** of the file **until the end of the file is reached**. This allows you to **read large files efficiently** without loading the entire file into memory at once. 

Here's an example:

```lua
-- Loop through each line in the file
for line in io.lines("myfile.txt") do
  print(line)
end
```

> The `io.lines` function also **handles closing the file automatically**.

## Practice

```lua
??? ??? in ???("myfile.txt") do
  ???(line)
end
```

- for
- line
- io.lines
- print
