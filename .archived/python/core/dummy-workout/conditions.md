# Conditions

---
## Content

Python uses *booleans* to evaluate conditions. A boolean variable has two values, true and false, and one of these will be returned once a condition has been evaluated.

The `=` character can be combined with itself and other characters for a number of uses:
- `=` is used for variable assignment
- `==` is used for a boolean comparison
- `!=` means is not equal to

For example:

```python
# variable declaration and assignment
num = 6

# returns and prints true
print(num == 6)

# returns and prints false
print(num < 4)

# returns and prints true
print(num != 12)
```
