# Functional Stateless Components in React

---
## Content

Any **React** component that has no state and returns the same markup given the same `props` is known as a **stateless** component.

In React 0.14 stateless components can be written as **functions**. 

In the new syntax `props` is taken as an argument and the element you want to render is returned. The pattern is:
```jsx
const Text = (props) => 
    <p>{props.children}</p>;
```

Stateless components are likely to represent a large portion of your app.

???

* When it has no state.
* When it has no props.
* When it's a function.
