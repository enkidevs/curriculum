# **React** `this.props.children`

---
## Content

`this.props.children` is an opaque data structure backed by the `React.Children`  class.

You can't access the children of your component using `this.props.children` because it designates the children being passed onto you by the owner.

```jsx
var App = React.createClass({
  componentDidMount: function() {    
    console.log(this.props.children);
  },
  render: function() {
    return <div><span/><span/></div>;
  }
});
ReactDOM.render(<App></App>, mountNode);
```
In the code snippet above, `this.props.children` won't refer to the `<span>`'s, but to the **undefined** children between `<App></App>`.

`ref`'s should and must be used to access subcomponents.
