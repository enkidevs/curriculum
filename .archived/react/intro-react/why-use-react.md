# Why use **React**?

---
## Content

**React** is considered a great choice for building the **UI** of web applications - be it simple *SPAs*[1] or
large projects with numerous authors due to the **self-containing** nature of its *components*.

In addition to the previously stated reasons developers are eager to adopt this library, **React** comes with many more interesting features such as:

- great *performance* as a result of the **Virtual DOM** diff algorithm
- **React**'s syntax is simple. Unlike other popular `JS` frameworks with specific syntax, **React** makes use of pure `JS`
- easier debugging with **out-of-the-box tools** such as `React Chrome Extension`
- **React** is good for *Search Engine Optimization* when employing server-side rendering
- knowing **React** allows you to easily switch to **React Native** to build applications

**React Native** is a different `JS` open source library released by *Facebook* that follows the same design patterns as **React**.
It's used to create applications for specific operating systems such as `Android`, `iOS` or `UWP`[2], but it lets you share a large percentage of code between them.

## Footnotes
[1:SPA]

**Single-Page Applications** (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single `HTML` page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.

[2:UWP]

**Universal Windows Platform** (UWP), is a platform-homogeneous application architecture created by *Microsoft* intended to help the development of universal applications that can run on multiple types of devices (*PC* and *Mobile*).
