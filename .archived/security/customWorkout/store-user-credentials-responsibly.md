When storing users' credentials in a database, never store their passwords in plain text.

There most common practice is to hash them using existing algorithms designed for passwords such as `bcrypt`, `scrypt` or `PBKDF2` (with a high iteration count). 

Their open source implementations are available for most programming languages.

Once a password is hashed it appears as randomly generated sequence of characters:

```
hash("hello") = 
    cf24dba5fb0a30e26e8b2ac5b9e29e1b161e
    c1fa7425e73043362938b9824as33af91349

```
As a result, if a database is compromised, an attacker won't receive plain password.
