## Content

Finally, we have Grey Hat hackers. 

A Grey Hat hacker is one that has characteristics of both a Black and a White Hat hacker.. These hackers will utilize the methods of a Black Hat, but are not maliciously motivated. They will anonymously hunt for exploits, and if found, either use them for their own gain or offer to fix it for a fee. 

Alternatively, Grey Hats may target groups that they percieve as corrupt or evil, known as **hacktivism**.
