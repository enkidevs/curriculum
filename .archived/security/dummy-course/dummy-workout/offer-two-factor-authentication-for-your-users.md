# Offer two factor authentication for your users 

---
## Content

The most practical way to strengthen authentication is to require a second factor after the username/password stage.

Since a password is something that a user _knows_, ensuring that the user also _has_ something prevents attackers that steal or gain access to passwords.

Solutions often include the generation of `one-time passwords`, which are delivered via SMS or in two-factor authentication applications.
