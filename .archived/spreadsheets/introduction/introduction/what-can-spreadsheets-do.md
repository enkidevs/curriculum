# What Can Spreadsheets Do

---
## Content

Spreadsheets are great with numerical data. You can perform simple (such as addition, subtraction, etc.) or complex (multiple functions at the same time) calculations.

There are many formulas that can be used to organize, calculate, or find the data that you need. You can even set up formulas to change the color of certain cells based on calculations or if a condition is met. 

After transforming your data, you can create graphs or charts to better represent or visualize the results.

Pivot tables are another important powerful feature of spreadsheets. These can be used on very large data sets to extract or aggregate the data resulting in an improved view.

This is just a part of what spreadsheets can do, but we will cover all the features in the following missions.
