# LIKE, IN, BETWEEN

## Content

SQL provides a bunch of special operators to help you write complex querying conditions. More specifically, in the next two insights, we will take a look at:

- the `LIKE` operator, which is used to define a pattern that the given attribute should conform to
- the `IN` operator, which allows us to define a list of values of which the attribute must be one
- the `BETWEEN` operator, which allows us to define a range of values in which the attribute must be

Let's consider the following `pokemon` table:

| name       | total | hp | attack | defense |
|------------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Bulbasaur  | 318   | 45 | 49     | 49      |
| Ivysaur    | 405   | 60 | 62     | 63      |
| Venusaur   | 525   | 80 | 82     | 83      |
| Charmander | 309   | 39 | 52     | 43      |
| Charmeleon | 405   | 58 | 64     | 58      |
| Charizard  | 534   | 78 | 84     | 78      |
| Squirtle   | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |
| Wartortle  | 405   | 59 | 63     | 80      |
| Blastoise  | 530   | 79 | 83     | 100     |
| Caterpie   | 195   | 45 | 30     | 35      |
| Metapod    | 205   | 50 | 20     | 55      |

The `IN` condition allows you to easily test if a value inside a column matches any one specific item in a list of values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE name IN ('Charmander',
  'Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur');
```

In this case, we will only get the rows of the three starter Pok√©mon: Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

| name       | total | hp | attack | defense |
|------------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Bulbasaur  | 318   | 45 | 49     | 49      |
| Charmander | 309   | 39 | 52     | 43      |
| Squirtle   | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |

## Practice

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping only the rows where the name is one of: `'Groudon'`, `'Snorlax'` or `'Wailord'`.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pokemon
??? ??? ??? ???;
```

* WHERE
* name
* IN
* ('Groudon', 'Snorlax', 'Wailord')
* SUCH THAT
* IS ONE OF
* ['Groudon', 'Snorlax', 'Wailord']
