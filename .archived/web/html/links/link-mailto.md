## Content

The HTML anchor `mailto:EMAILHERE` attribute is used to create a hyperlink, which when clicked opens the users default email program with the email address auto loaded to allow them to send a message.

Creating a link to open the user's default email program:
```html
<a
  href="mailto:me@enkipro.com">
  Email me here
</a>
```

Result:
```
Email me here
```

Next to just opening the user's default email program, you can also populate the subject area.

**Note: When adding the subject, it is important to remember that instead of space you need to write `%20`.**

Example:
```html
<a
  href="mailto:me@enkipro.com?
        subject=Email%20Subject">
Email me
</a>
```

Result:
```html
Email me
```
