## Content

We are going to create a simple Hello Android app using the following directions below:
Open Android Studio and on the Welcome menu, click on Start a New Android Studio Project. A new project window opens and the following information will appear to include: 

*	Application Name. This will appear to users. Example name it First App. 
*	Company Domain. This is the name of your company. This is used to generate the package name below the field  
  and a package namespace for your app. 
*	Project Location. This is the location in which you want to place your project in. Click Next. 
* Leave Phone and Table checked and leave the Minimum SDK at the default. Click Next. 
* Select Empty Activity selected and click Next.
*	Leave all the details for the activity in their default state. Click Finish.
*	Android Studio may take at least a minute or two to set up. 
*	Hit the run button to test your app (looks like a green play button).
*	If there are no errors, you will be prompted to run on a specific device or on an emulator. 

In the future insights, we will get more in depth of what each section means and how to use it.
