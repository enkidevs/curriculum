Android can be written on a PC, Macs, and Linux machines. To write programs or code, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is needed which is Android Studio. Android Studio is free to download which works on all platforms. JDK(Java Development Kit) and Android SDK is needed. JDK is used to write Java programs.
To get started developing Android, we need Android SDK. This software development kit provides developers to build, compile, test and analyze applications. 
The Android SDK includes:
A mobile device emulator, which is a virtual mobile device that runs on your computer. The emulator allows you to develop and test Android applications without using a physical device. 
Debugging tools – identify issues in the application and fix them. 
Analyzing and Optimizing tools –used to optimize speed and performance. 

Check to see if you have JDK or 8 on your computer. If not, please visit https://www.java.com/verify if you are Windows user. If you are Mac/Linux user, open the terminal window and type "which javac". If you do not have Java on your machine, visit Oracle website to install the JDK to download the most recent version of Java SE.

The next step is to download the most recent version of Android which is http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html for your operating system. 

After launching Android Studio, select the check for updates option in the toolbar.
Additional packages are needed to be install for Android Studio. This can be done by opening up Android, click Configure on the Welcome menu. Select the SDK manager and select the following packages: Select all items under Tools. Select Android API 19. In the extras category, select Android Support Repository, Android Support Library, Google Repository, and Google USB Driver. Select Install Packages and Accept the License agreement.
