## Content

C++ has the following primary(built-in) data types:

* int
* char
* bool
* float
* void   

int VS float
In C++ int is the integer data type and represented in a binary format(0 or 1) . float data type is real numbers(decimal). For example: float 3,14. Int has a size of 8 bits with range between -2147483648 to 2147483647. On the other hand, float has a size of 4 bits with range between +/- 3.4e +/- 38 (~7 digits).

char VS bool
char is the character data type and bool is a boolean(true or false) in C++. char has size of 1 byte with range between 0 to 255. boolean has size of 1 byte with values of true or false only.

void
The most commonly used C++ data type. For example: public void.  

Case sensitivity
NOTE: C++ is case sensitive which means whether you use uppercase or lowercase letters matters. The words Int and int mean different things to the compiler.

## Practice

Which of the following IS NOT a C++ data type:

* printf
* integer
* character
* boolean


If we want to represent a character, which data type will use:

* char
* float
* int
* printf

Find the correct data type, according C++ case sensitivity:

* int
* Int
* integer
* Integer

What do float data types hold?

* integers
* two integers
* decimals
* None of the above

## Revision

What do bool data types hold?

* true or false
* two integers
* decimals
* None of the above

Which of the following IS NOT a C++ data type:

* scanf
* integer
* character
* boolean

Find the correct data type, according C++ case sensitivity:

* char
* Char
* character
* Character

If we want to represent an integer, which data type will use:

* int
* float
* char
* scanf
