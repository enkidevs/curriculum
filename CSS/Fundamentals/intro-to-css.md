## Content

**CSS** (short for Cascading Style Sheets) is a scripting language that developers use to style a webpage.

HTML defines the structure of a webpage page and JavaScript take care of the interactivity of the page. CSS is used to customize the appearance of the page. We can apply CSS to our HTML tags to change their color, size and position. 

It is best practice to seperatoe CSS from HTML and keep our CSS in a style sheet.
