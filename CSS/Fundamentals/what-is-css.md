## Content

**CSS**, also known as **Cascading Style Sheets**, is a styling language that can be applied to HTML, XML or SVG documents.

CSS is very important to get to know about, because pretty much every website nowadays uses it to customize HTML elements.

As for any project, functional separation of the files is recommended. Following this rule, we can split the files of a website into three categories: *structure*, *presentation* and *behavior*.

CSS is the one that takes care of the *presentation*. (HTML takes care of the structure and JavaScript looks after the behavior.)

There are several advantages to splitting the roles:
 - No code duplication, as the CSS file can be used for similar looking pages of the website.
 - A consequence of less code is less data to be transmitted, which is important for users with a slow internet connection.
 - The *presentation* can be changed without modifying the *content*.


CSS can change the HTML elements' color and size, their positioning, and can even animate them.
