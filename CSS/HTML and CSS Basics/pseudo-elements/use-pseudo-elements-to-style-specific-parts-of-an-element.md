## Content

Pseudo-elements are preceded by two colons `::`.

The syntax is as follows:
```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```
An example of a pseudo-element is `::before`. This will create and style a pseudo-element placed before the real element.

Some of the pseudo-elements are:
- `::before`: comes before the element's content.
- `::after`: comes after the element's content.
- `::first-letter`: targets the first letter of a paragraph.
- `::first-line`: targets the first line of a paragraph.
- `::selection`: targets a portion that is selected by the user.

It is worth noting that some browsers don't support `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements for `img` and `input` fields.
