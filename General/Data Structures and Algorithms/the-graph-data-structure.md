## Content

**Graphs** are a way of representing relationships between pairs of objects. They consists of objects (called *nodes* or *vertices*) and the pairwise connections between them (called *edges*).

Graphs come in two flavors: **directed graphs** (*digraph*) and **undirected graphs**. In a directed graph the edges have a direction, like a one-way street. Conversely, in an undirected graph, the edges have no notion of direction.

For example, *trees* and *linked lists* are special kinds of directed graphs.
You can also use graphs to represent friendship on social networks.

*Facebook*, for instance, is organized as an *undirected graph* (you appear on each other's friend list), while *Twitter*, is organized as a *directed graph* (you can follow someone without them following you back).



There can be more *directed edges* with the same origin and destination nodes, and more *undirected edges* to have the same end nodes. These are called **parallel edges** or **multiple edges**.

A **self-loop** is an edge for which the 2 nodes coincide.

We call **simple graph** one that does *not contain self-loops or multiple edges*.
