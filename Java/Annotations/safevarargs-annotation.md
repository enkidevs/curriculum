//FUCK KNOWS IF ITS RIGHT OR NOT IDK

**SafeVarargs** annotation refers to a method that makes use of multiple arguments under `VarArgs` declaration. The point of this annotation is to force compiler to raise an error upon a wrong usage of these arguments. Before Java 1.7 these errors were not mandatory for compilers to raise and from version 1.5 (introduction of `VarArgs`) and 1.7 programmers had to implicitly specify `@SafeVarargs` to ensure that the compiler raises an error upon a wrong usage.

**NOTE:** this annotation is no longer necessary to use as compilers raise this type of errors by themselves.
