*Arrays* and *Linked Lists* are similar in terms that they both store their elements linearly. The difference thought comes in the implementation concept. While arrays are fixed in size linked lists can be increased and decreased in size easily. Both of these data structures have their advantages over one another.

Arrays:
* Fixed in size which implies that if it has been predefined, then it occupies the same amount of memory through out its' lifetime.
* Arrays support random access meaning that we can access any position at any time.
* Linked Lists occupy more memory even with the same exact elements as they must store pointer information.

Linked Lists:
* Can be changed in length easily.
* We don't need to know our position in a list in order to access the next element as we are provided with pointers.

Why are arrays more memory efficient?

Why are arrays more memory safe?

???

* They don't store any additional information such as next element pointer
* They are of a fixed length
* Elements in array can only be accessed by index
