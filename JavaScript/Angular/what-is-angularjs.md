## Content

Front-end web developers rely most heavily on JavaScript to create the interactive aspects of a website that 
users see in their browsers—and, where there’s JS, there are frameworks and libraries being employed to streamline 
and simplify its complex code. 

**AngularJS** is a comprehensive JavaScript framework—and it gives AngularJS developers everything they need to 
set up the front-end of a web application, with a modular approach to web design and a large support community.
**AngularJS** is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. 

**AngularJS** is a full featured JavaScript framework, with the core goal of _simplification_. 
It excels at building dynamic, _SPAs_[1] and supports the _MVC_[2] programming 
structure. It powers sites include _Google, Virgin America, and HBO’s mobile site for iPad_.

## Footnotes

[1:SPA]
**SPA** stands for **Single Page Application**. Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a 
single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. 

SPAs use _AJAX_ and _HTML5_ to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads.

[2:MVC]
**MVC** stands for **Model View Controller**. Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural 
pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. 

It divides a given application into three 
interconnected parts in order to separate internal representations of information from the ways 
that information is presented to and accepted from the user.

The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code 
reuse and parallel development.
