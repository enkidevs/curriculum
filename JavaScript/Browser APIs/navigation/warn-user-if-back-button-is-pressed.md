## Content

As to prevent the loss of data in some cases, you will want to warn the user before pressing the **back** button and leave the current page.

The following snippet will add a warning message if the button is pressed:
```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = function() { 
  return "Your work will be lost."; 
};

```
`onbeforeunload` event handler property contains the code executed when the `beforeunload` is sent. This event fires when a window is about to unload its resources. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable.
