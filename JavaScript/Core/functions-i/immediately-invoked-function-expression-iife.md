## Content

A common pattern in JavaScript is the Immediately-Invoked Function Expression or IIFE.

IIFE's are nameless or anonymous functions that are executed immediately.

They have the following structure:

```
(function(){
   ...
})();
```

The main benefit of IIFE's is restricting access to variables contained within.

When a function runs it creates its own execution context and by creating a function and running it immediately we ensure that the variables contained are inaccessible to external code.

IIFE's are a very useful approach for organising code and frequently used in libraries and frameworks.

## Revision

The syntax for declaring an IIFE function is:
```
(???{
 // code
})???;
```
*`function()`
*`()`
*`functionName()`
*`{}`
*`apply`
