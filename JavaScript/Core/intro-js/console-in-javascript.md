## Content

The `console.*` methods output information to a console.

For example, `console.log` can print out a message or show details of an object:
```
console.log("Username: " + username);
// Username: enkilondon
```
In JavaScript there is no specification for how `console.*` methods behave. Each environment adds its own methods and behaviour. 

It is considered best practice to not include any `console.*` methods in production code.
