The `console.*` methods output information to a console.

For example, `console.log` can print out a message or show details of an object:
```
console.log("Username: " + username);
// Username: enkilondon
```

A few other useful console methods include:
Sending a warning to the console.
```
console.warn("Resource not changed")
```
Sending an error message to the console.
```
console.error("File not found!")
```
Viewing the current stack trace.
```
console.trace()
```


In JavaScript there is no specification for how `console.*` methods behave. Each environment adds its own methods and behaviour. 

When creating a web application, the use of `console.*` is critical for quickly debugging problems. Whenever you need more information on a variable, or would like to know where your code stops working, you should apply a console statement at the area in question. `console.*` statements can be viewed in Google Chrome by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+i`, and in Firefox by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+k`.

In addition to this, `console.*` can be used to pipe information to `stdout` in NodeJS.

**It is considered best practice to not include any `console.*` methods in production code.**
