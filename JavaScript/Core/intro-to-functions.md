## Content

A function is a package of code that accomplishes a particular task. You can write a function that takes in one or more inputs, performs a task and produces an output.

```
function add(x, y){
//x and y are inputs
	return x + y;
}
//the output of this function will be the sum of these two inputs
```
**Calling functions**

Your function will not run if you do not call it. To call your function, use its name and specify the input you want it to take in.
```
add(2, 3); //your function will return the output of 5
add(4, 4); //your function will return the output of 8
```
A function is useful because you can reuse it. This saves you from writing the same code again. You can call your add function as many times as you'd like with any inputs of your choosing.

## Practice

What would the output of this function be?
```
function subtract(x, y){
  return x - y;
}

subtract(8, 4);
???
```

*`4`
*`8`
*`error`

## Revision

```
function mult(x, y){
  return x * y;
}

mult(3, 3);
???
```
