## Content

The language that would become JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 and then standardised by an organisation called ECMA as **EcmaScript-262**. 

JavaScript is considered a **dialect** (or implementation) of EcmaScript but there are other popular dialects in use such as Adobeâ€™s ActionScript.

At the time of writing the current version of EcmaScript is **EcmaScript 2016** which is also sometimes referred to as **EcmaScript 6** or just **ES6**.

**EcmaScript and Web Pages**
 
EcmaScript has no methods for manipulating or working with web pages.

When people use the word JavaScript they are usually referring to EcmaScript and extensions such as the **DOM** (Document Object Model) that defines methods for manipulating web pages and the **BOM** (Browser Object Model) that provide functionality for working with the browser.
