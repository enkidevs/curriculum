## Content

The `with` statement shortens code by making it unnecessary to repeat object references.

For example:
```
var a, x;

with (Math) { 
  x = random();
  a = exp(x);
} 
```
There are however many potential pitfalls to using `with`:
* You can easily make global variables by mistake.

* It can be difficult to read.

* The compiler disables optimisation operations.


It is not recommended that you use `with` and it is not allowed in ES5 **strict mode**.

## Practice

Change the code in order for it to run without using `with` :
```javascript
var a, x;
  
/* with (Math) { 
  x = random();
  a = exp(x);
} */
x = ??? ;
a = ??? ;
```  
*Math.random()
*Math.exp(x)
*Math.exp()
*Math.random(x)

*you can make global variables by mistake.
*it shortens code.
