**Array.copyWithin** copies part of an array into the same array without modifying the original arrays size.
 
When you use Array.copyWithin changes occur on the array itself so you donâ€™t need to assign the result to another variable.

This is best explained with an example.

Let's say we have the following variable:
```
var alphabet = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
```

..And we want to copy the first two characters at position 2 we could utilize **Array.copyWithin** as follows:

```
alphabet.copyWithin(2,0,2);
\\ ["a","b","a","b","e"]
```

**Array.copyWithin** has 3 different method overloads:

```
copyWithin(
target,
position,
start (optional),
end (optional)
)
```

So we could shorten the above to:

```
alphabet.copyWithin(2)
\\ ["a","b","a","b","c"]
```

You can also use negative position parameters so we could use **Array.copyWithin** to copy to the last two characters:

```
alphabet.copyWithin(-2)
//["a","b","c","a","b"]
