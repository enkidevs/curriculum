## Content

Assigning a `const` to another variable and then changing the source variable will not change the value of the `const`:

```
var x= 1;
const y = x;
x = 5;
console.log(y); //still 1
```

Additionally note that modifying a property of an object referenced by a constant will _not_ throw an error and the property will be changed.

**const and objects**

Objects can also be declared as `const`.

```
const p = {first: "john", last: "smith"};

//below will cause errors:
p = 5;
p = {first: "bob", last: "smith"};
```

It is important to note however that the values of the object can be modified so the below is valid:

```
p.first = "bob"; //valid
```

If you donâ€™t want anyone to be able modify the object at all be sure to use `Object.freeze`[1] function.
