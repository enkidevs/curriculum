ECMAScript 6 (also referred to as ECMAScript 2015 and ES6) is the latest version of the standard managed by ECMA International that JavaScript now tracks.  

Version 6 introduces a number of exciting features that make it easier than ever to write robust and succinct code.

Weâ€™ll be looking at features such as constants, arrow functions, spread/rest operator, default parameters, extensions to existing types and much more!

It is important to note that if you intend to use some of the features that we will discuss that support varies widely across browsers and is changing all the time.

If you want to make use of these new features (and you should!) but also want to ensure that your code will run for a wide audience you will probably want to make use of a processor/compiler such as *Babel* that will transform the newer code into code understood by older platforms.
