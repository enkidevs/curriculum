String.raw is used to work with template strings and is best explained with an example:

In JavaScript **\n** is used to indicate a new line. 

Consider if we had the following template literal:
```
`Line1\nLine2!`;
```
When output this would be interpreted as below as \n signifies a new line:

```
"Line1
Line2"
```

However sometimes it is desirable to work with a string template in its raw format - **String.raw** allows you to do this - note how there is no new line between Line1 and Line2 now just \n:

```
String.raw `Line1\nLine2`;
// "Line1\nLine2"
```
