In the previous insight we defined a function called myFunc with the following signature:

```
function myFunc(literals, replacement){
...
}
```

When myFunc is called with a template literal the literals parameter will receive the following object:

```
["Hello ", 
" hows it going?", 
raw: Array[2]]
```

This object contains an array of the literal values and also a raw property that contains an array of the raw versions of the strings:

If your literal has multiple replacement values they will be mapped to subsequent function arguments:

```
function myFunc(
  strings, 
  subValue1, 
  subValue2){
...
}
```

Probably a better approach is to use the **rest** operator to map values to an array rather than define each argument:

```
function myFunc(strings, â€¦values){
...
}
```

With access to literals and replacement values you can use Tagged Template Literals to perform additional processing logic on a string and even replace the string entirely - for example:

```
function myFunc(strings, subValue){
 return "Goodbye " + subValue 
} 

myFunc `Hello ${company} hows it going?`
// "Goodbye Enki"
```
