Probably the primary use of symbols is to introduce changes into EcmaScript - this approach for example is used by ES6 with iterators for example.

**Symbol.iterator** is used to identify something that can be iterated over and  language features such as for of loops look for this to understand how to work with an object.

Don't worry too much about what the below code does just understand we are using a special inbuilt (referred to as well known) symbol to access this functionality:

```
let p = ["alex","bill","john"];
let it = p[Symbol.iterator]();
it.next().value; //alex
it.next().value; //bill
```

JavaScript contains a number of these "well known symbols" that couldn't be accessed prior to ES6 such as **Symbol.iterator** and **Symbol.match**. Note you won’t find any well-known symbols in the symbol registry either:

```
Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.iterator);
//undefined
```

Symbols can also implement a kind of limited (they are still accessible via other means) privacy – let's discuss this next.
