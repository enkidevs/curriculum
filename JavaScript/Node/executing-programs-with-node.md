## Content

The Node.js interpreter can be used to execute JavaScript files and programs in the terminal. First, create a JavaScript file:
```javascript
/* main.js */
console.log('Node.js with Enki!');
```
To run any JavaScript program using Node use the following generic command:

```bash
$ node filename.js
```

In this case, to run the *main.js* file the following command would be used:

```bash
$ node main.js
# that outputs:
Node.js with Enki!
```
