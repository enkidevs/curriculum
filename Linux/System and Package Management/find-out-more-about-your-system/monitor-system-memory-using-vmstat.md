`vmstat` allows the user to monitor virtual
memory statistics such as processes, memory,
paging, block IO, traps , disks and cpu
activity. 

The user can specify a sampling period.

```bash
$ vmstat 1
procs -----------memory----------
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache
 4  0 920708  74004  36324 114148
 ---swap-- -----io---- -system--
   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs
   29   53   125   112  298  212
 ----cpu----
 us sy id wa
 26  6 65  3
```

The above will run `vmstat` every second and
display system virtual memory usage such
as:
- `r` number process waiting to run
- `b`
blocked process
- `swpd` virtual memory used
- 
`free` idle memory
-  `bi`, `bo` number of
blocks sent and received from disk
- `us`
time spent in user code 
- `sy` time spent in
kernel code 

As current Linux blocks are `1024` bytes, `vmstat` uses the same unit of measurement for memory.
