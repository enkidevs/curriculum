## Content

Python has two tools for building functions, `def` and `lambda`.

Python's `lambda` tool is used for building function objects in situations where a simple one-off function is required. 

Lambda, when used in the correct situations, makes code writing easier and makes the written code cleaner and easier to read.

For example, a normal function using `def`:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
```
The same function but defined with `lambda`:

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
```
Note: Lambda should only be used when a function is a one-off function, and won't be used again after that.

## Revision

Complete the bottom code snippet to define the following function but with lambda:

```
def square(x): 
    return x * x 
```
With lambda:
```
square = ??? ???: x * x 
```
*`lambda` 
*`x` 
*`def` 
*`new` 
*`instance` 
*`function`
