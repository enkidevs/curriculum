# Enki Content

Welcome to our open-source content repository! At Enki, we feel that education is a community effort, and is best approached when everyone is involved and engaged. To that end, we have an enrirely open-source curriculum available for you to edit, comment on, and contribute to!

Learning happens best in a psycologically safe environment, so we've adopted the [contributor convenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our code of conduct. If a list of rules isn't helping you envision what we're after, [here's another great resource](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) (from The Recurse Center, read the Social Rules section) for how to participate in creating a community you'd like to be a part of. We _will_ enforce this, please get in touch with liz@enki.com with questions or concerns. **Everyone** is learning all the time, so disputes will be arbitrated first, and good-faith efforts are what is expected.

In simpler terms, it means you can't charge other people to use it, or use it to make money, but you can definately use it to help people learn and you're free to remix or adapt what we have, so long as you attribute Enki, and the author of the work. 

## Enki Content Contribution: How To

*Note: for company private content repos, please replace the https://github.com/sagelabs/content URL with your company’s private content repo URL.*

## To work on the content repo locally
1. First, clone the content repo: https://github.com/sagelabs/content
2. Now, install generator-enki which is a tool that renders an insight template for you quickly and easily.
3. To install, navigate to https://github.com/enkidevs/generator-enki and follow the ReadMe.
4. `git pull` to update the content repo’s latest changes before each session.


## To work on the content repo on the GitHub website
1. Navigate to https://github.com/sagelabs/content
2. Find the relevant topic and subtopic folder.
3. Create files or edit existing files and make pull requests on a new branch directly on the GitHub content repo.

## To create a topic
1. Navigate to the root folder of the content repo.
2. In Terminal, type `yo enki:topic`  
3. Follow the instructions in Terminal to create your topic.


## To create a subtopic

2. In Terminal, type `yo enki:subtopic` 
3. Follow the instructions in Terminal to create your subtopic.

**NOTE: Before create a subtopic for a non-existing topic in master branch, you need to create the topic and merge it first, if you don't do it, automated checks will throw a related error**

## To create a workout

All insights must be contained within a custom workout. Under a subtopic, you must create a folder with a `README.md` that specifies what is contained in the workout.

We don't have a generator for this yet, in lieu of that here is an example of a workout with a `README.md` file: https://github.com/sagelabs/content/tree/master/JavaScript/Core/array-methods
