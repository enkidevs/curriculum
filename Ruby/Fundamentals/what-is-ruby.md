## Content

**Ruby** is a dynamic, reflective, open source and object-oriented programming language.

It was created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and inspired by other languages like Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp to form a new balanced language.

It was designed for programmer productivity and fun. 

In Ruby, **everything is an object**, even numbers and strings. 

```ruby
3.times { puts 'Hello World!' }
#=> Hello World!
#=> Hello World!
#=> Hello World!
```

It has **duck typing**, that means variables have no data type and can hold any object.

Ruby is seen as a flexible language, since it allows its users to freely add, remove or redefine its essential parts[1], trying to not restrict the coder.


We will see more in detail its features in the next insights.
