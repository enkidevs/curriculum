A `text` data type is in many ways similar to `varchar`s. The only difference comes from the number of indexed characters (if it is the case of indexing for that specific column).

They are similar enough to the point in which MSSQL decided to drop it in the next versions and promote the use of `varchar(n)` and `nvarchar(n)`.
