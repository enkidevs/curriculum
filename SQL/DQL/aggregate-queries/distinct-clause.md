## Content

The `DISTINCT` keyword enables users to filter the duplicates that result after doing a `SELECT` query.

We will give some examples based on a database we have set up:
```
SELECT COUNT(ability_id)
FROM ability_name;

--Result:
count
======
 1397
(1 row)
```
First, we count how many ability ids are there in the ability_name table.
If we would like to see how many of them are `DISTINCT`:

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ability_id)
FROM ability_name;

--Result:
count
======
  251
(1 row)
```

---
## Practice

We know that the table *pokedex_name* has a field called name with 42 entries. We would like to see how many of these are distinct values. Which query do you think will have the desired output?
```
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM pokedex_name;

--Result:
count
======
   42
(1 row)

???

--Result:
count
======
   35
(1 row)
```

* SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM pokedex_name;
* SELECT * FROM pokedex_name;
* SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(name) FROM pokedex_name;
* DISTINCT SELECT COUNT(name) FROM pokedex_name;

## Revision

Consider the following table and the following query. Fill the gaps such that we will have no duplicates in the resulting table:
```
--GRADES table:

|   NAME    | GRADES |
|===========|========|
| John      | 56%    |
| Sebastian | 68%    |
| Doris     | 56%    |
| Alice     | 88%    |
| Stefan    | 68%    |
| Raul      | 50%    |

SELECT ???
FROM ???
??? BY GRADES;
```

* `DISTINCT name`
* `GRADES`
* `ORDER`
* `EMPLOYEES`
* `*`
