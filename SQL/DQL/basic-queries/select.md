## Content

To get all of the data from a table, you can use a `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon;
```

The above command gets all of the *columns* and all of the *rows* from the `pokemon` table.

We can also use the `SELECT` statement to specify the exact *columns* we want to keep from the table, and to discard the others.

```sql
SELECT id, weight, name
FROM pokemon;
```

The above command gets only the `id`, `weight`, and `name` columns from the table, but keeps all of the rows of the `pokemon` table. Remember, the information is not deleted, you're simply **querying** the database, but doing so in a way where you only receive the information contained in the specified columns.
