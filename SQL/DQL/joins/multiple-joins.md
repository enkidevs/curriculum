Sometimes, a single join might not be enough to get the desired result. In `many-to-many` relationships, when an intermediate table is used to avoid data duplication, such practice is common.

In the Pok√©mon database you can find multiple intermediate tables, usually named `table1_table2`: for the `pokemon` and `type` tables, the intermediate one is named `pokemon_type`. Same goes for `pokemon`, `move` and `pokemon_move`.

These are some table entries which contain only the columns relevant to the query. The `pokemon` table:
```
id   |   name
=====+============
1    |  bulbasaur
2    |  ivysaur
3    |  venusaur
```
The `pokemon_type` table:
```
id   |  slot  | pokemon_id | type_id
=====+========+============+===========
1    |   1    |      1     |     12
2    |   2    |      1     |     4
3    |   1    |      2     |     12
4    |   2    |      2     |     4
5    |   1    |      3     |     12
6    |   2    |      3     |     4
```
And the `type` table:
```
id   |  name
=====+=========
1    |  normal
...
4    |  poison
...
12   |  grass
```
The syntax is this:
```SQL
SELECT pokemon.name, type.name
FROM pokemon_type
LEFT JOIN pokemon
ON pokemon_type.pokemon_id = pokemon.id
LEFT JOIN type
ON pokemon_type.type_id = type.id;
```
This is effectively join the first two tables (*pokemon_type* and *pokemon*) and then join the resulting table with the *type* table.

These are the first four rows of output (out of 1225):
```
name        | name
============+==========
bulbasaur   | grass
bulbasaur   | poison
ivysaur     | grass
ivysaur     | poison
```
The same result can be achieved by using subqueries.

## Practice

Fill in the gaps:
```SQL
SELECT pokemon.name, LJoinRes.level,
  LJoinRes.name, LJoinRes.version_group_id
??? pokemon
??? (SELECT *
FROM pokemon_move
LEFT JOIN move ???
pokemon_move.move_id = move.id) ??? LJoinRes
ON pokemon.id = LJoinRes.pokemon_id
ORDER BY pokemon.id,
  LJoinRes.version_group_id, LJoinRes.level;
```
???

* `FROM`
* `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
* `ON`
* `AS`
* `pokemon`
* `OUTER JOIN`
* `SELECT`
* `ORDER BY`

## Revision

Is the following statement true or false?

In order to join multiple tables together, subqueries must be used.

???
* false
* true
