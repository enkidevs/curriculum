The insight should provide enough information for the following questions to be answerable:

  - T/F: Every HTML element requires both an opening and closing HTML tag. 
    - F
  - Which of these characters represents an end tag?
    - /
    - ^
    - <
    - *
    - >
    - \
  - HTML tags are recommended to be written in which case?
    - lowercase*, uppercase, camelcase, no recommendation
      - Technically, HTML5 doesn‚Äôt care and is not sensitive to the case, but developers tend to agree that lowercase is easier to read, is more common which helps with consistency to prevent confusion, and it‚Äôs a bit of a pain to toggle caps lock to write code. 
  - üêâ Although HTML5 does not require HTML tags to be written in lowercase, ??? does. 
      - XHTML
  - What are the tags used in this code: 
      <h1>Large Text Heading</h1>
      <img src=‚Äùphotos/image.jpg‚Äù>
      <p>I‚Äôm just a simple paragraph.</p>
      - <h1></h1><img><p></p>
