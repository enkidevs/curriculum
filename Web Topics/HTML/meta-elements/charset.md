The insight should provide enough information for the following questions to be answerable:

  - What charset is used for character encoding in HTML5 web pages today?
    - utf-8
  - What does this code do?
      <meta charset="utf-8"> 
    - It tells the browser how to display the characters within the web page for all kinds of languages and symbols, like French accents (I love a good souffl√©.)
