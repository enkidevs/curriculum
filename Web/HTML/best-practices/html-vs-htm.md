# .html vs .htm
---
## Content

`.html` and `.htm` are both file extensions for HTML. 

The only difference is that `.htm` was used in the early days when operating systems like DOS did not support file extensions past 3 characters. 

This meant that early DOS users could only use the `.htm` extension.

As for Macintosh users, there was no 3 character limitation, so early Mac users used the `.html` extension.

Later on, when operating systems became stronger, limiting extensions to 3 characters was no longer necessary. Nevertheless, `.htm` extension was still widely used, mostly because people were already used to it.
