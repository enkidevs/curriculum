# Cite Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<cite>` element is used to describing a reference to a cited `creative work`. This element has to contain either the title or the URL of the cited work.

What falls under creative work:
  - A blog post or comment
  - A book
  - A computer program
  - An essay
  - An exhibition
  - A Facebook post
  - A film
  - A forum post or comment
  - A game
  - A legal case report
  - A musical
  - A musical score
  - An opera
  - A painting
  - A play
  - A play or film script
  - A poem
  - A research paper
  - A sculpture
  - A song
  - A television show
  - A theatrical production
  - A tweet
  - A web site
  - A web page
  - A written or oral statement
  - And more...


Example:
```
<p>
  More information about music 
  <cite>
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music]
  </cite>.
</p>
```

The cited URL under the `<cite>` element will, by default, display in <i>italic</i>. However, this is easily editable by adding the `font-style` CSS property to the `<cite>` element.
