## Content

In HTML the `<code>` element is used to style the content to display like a fragment of a computer code.
Both the starting and ending tags are necessary.

Example:
```
<p>
  The function
  <code>
    calculateAverage() 
   </code> 
  calculates the average
  of a set of numbers
</p>
```
Result:
 The funcion `calculateAverage()` calculates the average of a set of numbers.
 
The default font style for the `<code>` element for most browsers is the monospace font.
 
**Note: It's best to use the `<code>` element to style content for HTML elements, CSS rules, filenames and JS scripts.**
