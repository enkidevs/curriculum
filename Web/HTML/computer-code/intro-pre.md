## Content

In HTML the `<pre>` element is used to represent preformatted text as it is in the HTML file.

**Note:**
  - **pre stands for Preformatted Text Element.**
  - **Both the starting and ending tags are necessary.**
  - **Whitespace inside the element is displayed as written.**

Example:
```
<pre>
 body {
  color: blue;
 }
</pre>
```

Result:
```
body {
 color: blue;
}
```
 
In the example above, the `<pre>` element is used to produce a block element of an output from a computer program.

The default font style for the `<samp>` element for most browsers is the monospace font.
