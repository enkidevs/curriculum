# Hyperlinks
---
## Content

Hyperlinks are links in HTML. They are very useful for navigating from one document to another.
By default, unclicked links are blue, highlighted and underlined. 
Whereas links you have already clicked on at least once are red.

Hovering over hyperlinks changes the cursor to a pointer.

The hyperlink is defined with the `<a>` tag:
```
<a 
  href="URL">Link text
</a>
```
or
```
<a 
  href="https://www.enki.com/"> 
  5-minute workouts
</a>
```
Result:
```
5-minute workouts
```

In the example above, the `5-minute workouts` is the hyperlink, and by clicking on the text you are taken to the URL provided in the `href="URL"` attribute. 

The attribute `href` is the most important element because it specifies the destination(URL).

Where the link opens is set with the `_target="???"` attribute.

 - _self     = Opens the link in the same tab or window
 - _top      = Opens the link in the full body of the window
 - _parent   = Opens the link in the parent frame
 - _blank    = Opens the link in a new tab or window
 - framename = Opens the link in a named frame

Opening the link in a different tab:
```
<a 
  href="https://www.enki.com/" 
  target="_blank"> 
  5 minute workouts 
</a> 
```
**Note:If no target is set, the linked page or document is opened in the current tab.**

You can also create `placeholder` links. These are links that can be clicked, but do nothing.

```
<a 
  href="#"> Empty href
</a>
```

Next to linking through text, it is also common to link through pictures.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<a 
   href="https://www.enki.com/" 
   target="_blank">
  <img 
    src ="http.logo.com/enki.png"
    alt ="Enki logo"
    style="width:36px;height:36px;"
   />
</a>
 
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the picture with the URL `http.logo.com/enki.png` becomes the link.
