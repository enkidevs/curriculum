# Intro span

## Content

The HTML `<span>` element is used group inline HTML elements. By itself, the element does not represent any visual change by itself, but it can be used to group and style inline elements or group elements with similar attribute values.

**Notes:**
  - **Only use `<span>` if you don't have a more appropriate semantic element.**
  - **`<div>` and `<span>` are very similar, except `<div>` is a block element, whereas `<span>` is an inline element.

The `<span>` element supports global attributes. To learn more about global attributes visit the `more info` section at the bottom of this insight.

Example:
```
<p>
  <span>
    Simple Paragraph
  </span>
</p>
```

The above example does pretty much nothing, whereas this example:
```
<p>
 <span style="color:green">
  This Is Green
 </span>
</p>
```

Styles the text green.
