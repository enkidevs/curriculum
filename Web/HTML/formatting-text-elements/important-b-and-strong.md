# Important (b & strong)
---
## Content

The HTML `<b>`, or **The Bring Attention To element** is used to bring readers attention to some text and `<strong>`, or **The Strong Importance element**, is used to give importance to some content.

The `<b>` element was also formerly known as the **Boldface element**.

Example:
```
<p>
  <strong>Warning</strong>: 
  The latest 
  <b>iPhone</b> is expensive.
</p>
```
Result:

**Warning**: The latest **iPhone** is expensive.


The `<strong>` element is used to specify that some content is very important and serious. Like in the example above, `<strong>` is used to encapsulate the word `Warning`  and the `<b>` element is used to give attention to a text without giving it a higher importance, like the `iPhone` word. Also, you shouldn't use the `<b>` nor `<strong>` elements for styling purposes. If you want to style some content to be **bold**, you should use the `font-weight:bold;` CSS property or if the content is of higher importance, you should specify so by adding the `<strong>` element. On the other hand, if you need to *stress emphasis* on a word, you should use the `<em>` element.(more on this in later insights)
  
Both elements include the global attributes. If you wish to know more about global attributes, visit the more info section at the bottom of this insight.

The `<strong>` and `<b>` elements both have the same default styling, **bold**, and neither of them should be used just to turn some text **bold**!

Another example:
```
<strong>
  Attention!
</strong>
The floor is 
<b>slippery</b> 
 and <b>wet</b>!
```
Result:

**Attention!** The floor is **slippery** and **wet**!
