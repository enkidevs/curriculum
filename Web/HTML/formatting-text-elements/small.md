## Content

The HTML `<small>` element, often referred to as `fine print` is used to change the font size of some text to one size smaler(from large to medium or medium to small, etc.), up to the smallest size the browsers allows.

This element is used for adding short phrases or comments, short blocks of text, a copyright notice or other legal text.

Example:
```
<small>This is small.</small>
```

Or you can achieve the same effect with CSS:
```
<span 
  style="font-size:0.8em> 
  This is small.
</span>
```

Furthermore, this element supports global attributes. To read about global attributes check the `more info` section at the bottom of this insight.
