# Attributes
---
## Content

In HTML, elements can have attributes. They are placed in the opening tag and are there to provide extra information. 
They usually come in name/value pairs and are enclosed in quotation marks.

Example:
```
<img src="enki_logo.jpg">
```
In the example above the `src="enki_logo.jpg"` is an attribute for the `<img>` tag.
