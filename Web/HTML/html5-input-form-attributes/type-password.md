# Type=password
---
## Content

The HTML input form `type="password"` attribute is used to display each character either as an asterisk or a circle. This attribute is very similar to the `type="text"` attribute.

Example:
```
<form 
  action="/action.php">
  Username: 
  <input 
    type="text" 
    name="usrname"><br>
  <input
    type"password"
    name"password"><br>
  <input 
    type="submit" 
    value="Submit">
</form>
```

In the example above we have two input fields that look the same, but behave slightly differently.
The only difference is that the password field will replace and display each character with either an asterisk or a circle.
