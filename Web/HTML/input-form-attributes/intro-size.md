## Content

The HTML input form `size` attribute is used to define the initial size of an input control. This value is usually specified in pixels unless the input type equals `type="text"` or `type="password"`, in that case, it is an integer number of characters.


Since HTML5 this attribute works only for these input attribute types:
  - email
  - password
  - search
  - tel
  - text
  - url
  
The value of the `size` attribute must be greater than 0. If however, you do not specify the size, the default value used is 20.

Example:
```
<input 
  type="text" 
  name="twitter" 
  size="280">
```

**Note: Setting the `size` attribute is not the same as setting the maximum length. Setting the `size` attribute sets the visible width, in characters, of an input element. If you wish to set the maximum length use the `maxlength` attribute. **
