## Revision

The maxlength attribute within form’s input fields does not provide any feedback and if feedback to the user is needed, JavaScript code is required.

???

Although the default value with the number of characters allowed in the <input> element is unlimited, Google Chrome sets the cap at 524288.

???

The maxlength attribute can only be applied to the form elements <input> and <textarea>.

???

The maxlength attribute of form elements also limits placeholder attribute length.
