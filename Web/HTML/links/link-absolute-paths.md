# Absolute Paths
---
## Content

When wanting to link a file or a picture from some website to your website, you have to do it with an absolute link path.

Example image:
```
<p> Apple logo </p>
<img 
  src="http://www.apple.com/logo.svg"
  alt="Apple logo">
```

Example link:
```
<p> Google </p>
<a 
  href="http://www.google.com">
  Google
</a>
```
An absolute path is a full URL to an internet file or picture.
Only absolute paths can be used when linking to images/files of another website. 

Example of absolute paths:
 - `http://www.adobe.com`
 - `http://www.apple.com/images/logo.svg`
 - `http://www.enkipro.com/help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html`

**Note: For the absolute path link to work, you have to provide the domain name of the website, including the `http:// `.**

There is one downfall when it comes to using absolute link paths. You have no control over these files because they are located on other domains, and if they are moved, your links will break.
