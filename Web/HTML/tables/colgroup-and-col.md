# Colgroup & col

## Content

The HTML self-closing `<col>` element is used to define a column and the `<colgroup>` element is used to define a group of columns for an HTML table.

The `<col>` element provides common semantics and is usually located within the `<colgroup>` element.

The `<col>` element has one element-specific attribute; `span`. All other element specific attributes are obsolete since HTML5.

The `span` attribute is used to specify how many columns does the `<col>` element extend. If the attribute is not provided, the default value is `1`.

This element can also be used to define unique styles within columns.

You can edit the `<col>` element by using the appropriate CSS properties, for instance:
  - `width`
  - `text-align`

As for the `<colgroup>` element, just like with the `<col>` element, all element-specific attributes except the `span` attribute are obsolete. Additionally, you shouldn't use the `span` attribute on the `<colgroup>` element if there are one or more `<col>` elements present within the `<colgroup>` element.

The `<colgroup>` element is useful for applying styles to entire columns, rather than repeating styles for each cell in every row.

**Note**
Both `<col>` and `<colgroup>` elements support global attributes. If you wish to know more about global attributes, visit the more info section at the bottom of this insights.

Example with both elements:
```
<table>
 <colgroup>
  <col span="2" 
    style="background-color:lightblue">
  <col 
    style="background-color:hotpink">
  <col span="3" 
    style="background-color:mediumpurple">
 </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td>col 1</td>
    <td>col 2</td>
    <td>col 3</td>
    <td>col 4</td>
    <td>col 5</td>
    <td>col 6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

In the example above, the `<colgroup>` element is used to create a group of 3 `<col>` elements and the `<tr>` element is used to create a single row with 6 `<td>` elements. Each col element spans differently and has a different style; first `<col>` spans 2 columns and is `lightblue`, 2nd `<col>` spans 1 column and is `hotpink` and the third and last `<col>` spans 3 columns and is `mediumpurple`.

## Practice

Write the code to create the following table:

```
<table>
 <tag1>
  <tag2 span="2" 
   style="background-color:lightblue">
  <tag2 
   style="background-color:hotpink">
  <tag2 span="3" 
   style="background-color:mediumpurple">
  </tag1>
  <tr>
   <td>col 1</td>
   <td>col 2</td>
   <td>col 3</td>
   <td>col 4</td>
   <td>col 5</td>
   <td>col 6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
