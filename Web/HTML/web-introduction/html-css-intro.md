# HTML/CSS Introduction
---
## Content

**CSS** and **HTML** are the core languages used for creating web pages and web-based applications. **HTML** was invented in 1989, whereas **CSS** was invented in 1996.

**HTML**, or **HyperText Markup Language** is a markup language for creating the structure and content of a webpage. Whereas **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets** is used to modify the design and display of those **HTML** elements.

**HTML** is made up of content between `<tags>`, whereas **CSS** is made of selectors followed by a {declaration block}.

When creating a website, typically all of your files for the same website are located inside the same main folder; both HTML and CSS files.
