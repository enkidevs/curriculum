# The `body` Element
---
## Content

In HTML, the `<body>`, or **The Document Body element** is used to represent the body of an HTML document. It is also the element which holds all the content of an HTML page.

**Note: There can be only one `<body>` element per web page or document.**

The `<body>` element is an optional element, which means, under certain conditions, one or more of its tags can be omitted. The starting tag can be omitted if the first thing inside the `<body>` element is not a comment or a space character, nor a `<script>` or `<style>` element. Whereas the ending tag can be omitted if the `<body>` element has a starting tag, some content, or if it isn't immediately followed by a comment.


Example of a simple HTML document:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Enki</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


**Notes:**
 - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Required first line for every HTML page.
 - `<body>`: Holds all the page content.
 - `<head>`: Holds the doc title, scripts, styles, & meta information.


---
## Practice

Organize the structure of a simple HTML web page: 

```
???
???
 ???
  <title>Enki</title>
 ???
 ???
  <h1>Enki</h1>
  <p>We provide daily dev workouts.</p>
 ???
???
```
