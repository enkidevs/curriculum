# Reinforcement Learning Example

---
## Content

A real-world example of reinforcement learning is your social media feed. 

Each time you like an Instagram post, watch a TikTok video, or retweet a Tweet, you’re effectively rewarding the algorithm to serve you more of that kind of content.

Similarly, each time you dislike a post, skip a video, or report a tweet, you're "punishing" the algorithm to stop serving you such content.

## Revision

If you're training a robot to navigate a maze, where the robot receives a reward for reaching the end of the maze and a penalty for hitting a wall. 

Over time, the robot will learn the optimal path to the end of the maze, based on the rewards and penalties it has received.

This process is called ??? learning.
