# Neural Networks

---
## Content

Neural networks are inspired by how the brain works. 

![Neural Network Brain](https://img.enkipro.com/6ed5a555ba9c0ce3c4fc1116e6068adc.gif)

Think of a neuron as a light bulb that turns on when it recognizes a pattern.

> 💡 Turning on a neuron is called **activation**. 

There are no off neurons. No matter what's in the data, a neuron would at least be slightly dim.

> 💡 The baseline activation level of a neuron is called a **bias**[2]

How much it turns on, between dim or bright, depends on its sensitivity to different features in the input data[3].

> 💡 The sensitivity of a neuron to a feature is called a **weight**[3]

### Practice

The baseline activation level of a neuron is called a ???.

The sensitivity of a neuron to a data feature is called a ???.

- bias
- weight
- tendency
- tune

## Revision

The base decision maker of a neural network is called a ???.

Its sensitivity to data features is called a ???.

The default activation level independent of the input data is called a ???

- neuron
- weight
- bias
- cell
- sequence
- degree

## Footnotes

[1: Neuron Activation]
The activation function of a neuron is like a switch or a gatekeeper, determining whether a neuron should fire or not based on the input received.

For example, imagine you are a bouncer at a club and you need to decide who to let in based on their age. The activation function would be like the rule you follow to make this decision, such as "let in only people who are over 21 years old."

[2: Neural Network Bias]
A person's mood can affect their behavior, regardless of external circumstances. This can be thought of as a bias in the person's behavior. 

Similarly, in a neural network, a bias term can represent a constant value that affects the output of a neuron, regardless of the inputs it receives.

[3: Neural Network Weight]
The weight of a neuron in a neural network can be thought of as a dial that is adjusted to determine how much influence a specific feature of the data should have on the final output. 

In image recognition, the weight of a neuron may be adjusted to react more strongly to certain shapes or patterns in the image that are more indicative of an elephant.
