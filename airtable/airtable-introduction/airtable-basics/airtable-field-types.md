# Field Types


---

## Content

In the previous insight, we changed all our fields to the `Number` type. You may have noticed that there were many other options available, depending on your application.

Here's a list of the most common types.

### Single line text

- accepts any text as long as it fits on a single line
- good for names or short unique texts

### Long text

- accepts any text
- use it when the text is too long for the single line of text type

### Number

- accepts numbers depending on criteria defined by you
- can take integers or decimals
- pre-defined decimal point
- choice of including or excluding negative numbers

### Percentage

- insert a number which is a fraction of 100
- will show as `<number>%`
- you can choose the precision

### Currency

- insert a number that will be formatted as currency
- you can select the symbol (default is dollar)
- precision and including negative numbers are also possible options

### Email

- stores email addresses
- clicking on a record will open up the native email client and fill the `To` field with the address corresponding to the record clicked

### Date (and time)

- select a date from a calendar
- can also include time
- different formats are available

A complete list of field types and their description can be found in the resources section of this insight.
