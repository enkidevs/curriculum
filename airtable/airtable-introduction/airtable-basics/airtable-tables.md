# Tables


---

## Content

Suppose you've created a base from scratch. When you open it, you'll see something like this:

![empty-base](https://img.enkipro.com/bdaeb9da037d322efc7036f7f9704b49.png)

You can see that you're working in `Table 1`, which has three fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Attachments`.

For starters, you can rename the table so that it provides a very short description of what data it'll hold.

In this example, you also need a new table named `Earth Data`. You can do this by pressing the `+` button to the right of the `Mars Data` table:

Tables belong inside a base. In our example, both `Mars Data` and `Earth Data` are found in the same base.

You can link records from `Mars Data` to `Earth Data` (or vice versa), but you can't link records from a table that belongs to a **different** base.
