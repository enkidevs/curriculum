# Importing Data


---

## Content

In Airtable, there are three ways of creating a base:

- From a template
- From a spreadsheet
- From scratch

We've already discussed templates. Now let's take a look at importing data via spreadsheets. 

Imagine that you are a scientist researching and developing a drone that for flying to Mars. Using a formula you were able to create a `.csv`[1] file and you want to get this data into Airtable.

Assuming you don't want to manually insert all the records, click on the `Add a base` button, select the option that says `Import a spreadsheet` and upload the `.csv` file that you already had. At the end, you'll be prompted for the base name, color and other initial information.

In the example, we chose to upload a `.csv` file from our own computer. Some other upload options include:

- copy/pasting table data (e.g. from Excel or Google Sheets)
- uploading a `.csv` file from a URL
- uploading a `.csv` file from product like Google Drive and Dropbox

## Footnotes

[1:CSV]
The `.csv` extension stands for **Comma Separated Values**, a file type which is used to store data in plain sets. Each column is separated by a comma, and each new line represents a new row.
