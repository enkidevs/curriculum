# Using a Template


---

## Content

Suppose you're looking to move house and want to keep track of the houses you visit or consider. Let's give this template a try: [apartment hunting](https://airtable.com/templates/everyday-life/expPfTzGnfpwjgWlS/apartment-hunting).

The presentation page of the template contains a short description and a preview of the base:

If the template works for your project, clicking `Use template` will add it to your workspace.

You're now the proud owner of a new base 🎉🎉. Clicking on `Apartment Hunting` will open the base, which is populated with some sample data. In the following insights you'll learn how to edit the data and customize the base.
