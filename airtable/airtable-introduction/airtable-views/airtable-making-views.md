# Making Views


---

## Content

Let's say that you're working on a new product, and doing market research for it. This might include sending our surveys and analyzing the responses.

In Airtable, you can create a Form view, which can be sent to your users to complete. Each answer is recorded in the table, and it can be seen in the main view.

To begin, create a new table which you can name however you want (we chose `Market Research`). In the table, each field represents an entry that the user will have to fill in. You can start off with something simple, like this:

- `Full Name` - Single line text
- `Do you enjoy our product?` - Single select
- `Suggestions for improvement` - Long text
- `Rating` - Rating

We've also removed all the empty records (that come by default when creating a new table). Your table should now look something like this:

To create a new view, click on the `Grid view` button (seen in the top left corner of the example) and multiple options will be presented to you. Continue by clicking on `Form` and you're ready.

There you have it, your form is ready.
