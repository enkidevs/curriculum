# Views

## Content

In normal spreadsheets, the stored data is shown as is (without any modifications). This can lead to reduced readability and human errors (like reading off the wrong row).

One big feature of Airtable is that you can **view** your data in many different ways. For example, if you store meeting data in a table (including info on the person you're meeting, date and time, meeting notes, and so on), the table would look something like this:

![some-meeting-data](https://img.enkipro.com/7177e9e52c5df49d5c431c45ffc3a074.png)

Using this data, you can apply a calendar view to your table, which will now look like this:

![calendar-view-of-meeting-data](https://img.enkipro.com/932fe90d348a4ef918eb85c4a46c1719.png)

Other than the calendar view, Airtable includes:

- Grid (default)
- Form
- Gallery
- Kanban

One important factor is that although you can apply views to your table, the underlying data will be the same. This means that if you edit a record, the edit will happen for all views.

## Practice

Will editing a record in the Grid view change the record in the Form view? Both views belong to the same table.

???

- Yes.
- No.
- No, not in this case.
- Yes, but not in this case.
