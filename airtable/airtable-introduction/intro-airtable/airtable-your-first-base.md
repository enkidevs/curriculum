# Your First Base


---

## Content

The first time you log into Airtable you're presented with the following screen:

![airtable-dashboard](https://img.enkipro.com/89d47b7aad1f5b9ee20e2f3205e25cfe.png)

Let's ignore the first row for now, and click on `Add a base`. Now, you'll be presented with three main options:

- Start with a template
- Import from spreadsheet
- Start from scratch

Go ahead and select `Start from scratch` (we'll look at the other options in future insights). Next, select a:

- name
- color
- icon

You can either fill these in now or edit them at a later time. For now, we'll skip these options.

Success! You've created your first base. You can now see cells, rows, columns and many other options that we'll discuss later on.
