# Fields

---
## Content

A field in Airtable represents a column. In this example, `Name`, `Notes` and `Attachments` are all fields:

Since you want to store data related to Mars in this table, let's update the fields. You need three fields: `Height`, `Pressure`, and `Temperature`.

To edit a field name, you can either right click it, or press on the arrow pointing down (on the RHS of the cell with the field name).

When renaming a field, you'll also be asked for its type. For this example, choose `Number` for all three fields. It should be a decimal with double precision (e.g. `1.00`), and it should allow negative numbers.

A field type restricts the data that you can insert, and because we chose `Number` we can only insert numbers in our fields. Airtable gives you a heads up that changing the field type will erase previous data that does not fit, which happened in the example above.

## Practice

When changing the type of a field, what happens to the data that doesn't fit the new type?

???

* It's deleted.
* It's updated to the new type.
* You get an error.
