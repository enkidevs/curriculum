# Primary Fields


---

## Content

The primary field is the most important column in your table. It can't be deleted, moved, or hidden. **Its main use is to act as an identifier**. 

For example, when linking a record to another table, the data found in the primary field is displayed on a small card.

Use the primary field to describe the data that is found in that record. If you don't want to use text, you can always change the field's type. Although not all types are permitted, you can still use most of them.

The supported types for the primary field are:

- attachment
- checkbox
- single or multi select
- count
- fields that are used to link records
