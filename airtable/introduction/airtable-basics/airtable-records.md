# Records

---
## Content

In the base that we previously created, check out the four rows (`1`, `2`, `3`, and `+`):

The rows which have an identifier (ie. numbered) represent records, while the row with a `+` is a prompt to create a new record.

To edit a record, click in the cell that you want to update and insert the data. As an example, we'll insert some mock data in the `Mars Data` table:

A record is identifiable by its row number. For example, we have record `1` with its name `Airtable` and `Powerful spreadsheet-like database` as its notes. The same logic can be applied to records `2` and `3`.

Depending on the field's type, you can only enter certain data. In this example, both the `Name` and `Notes` fields take text input, while the `Attachments` field takes a file input (don't stress too much about this concept as it'll be explained in the insights coming up).

## Practice

In Airtable, a record is identifiable by its ???.

* row number
* third column
* `Notes` column
