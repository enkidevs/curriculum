# Editing Template Data

---
## Content

Without going into too much detail, let's see how you'd go about editing the imported template.

Let's take a look at the template:

![first-look-at-base](https://img.enkipro.com/145c0efb5e31f11c47c9b386e5d5bda8.png)

From the image above you can deduce that the base is called `Apartment Hunting`, and it contains two tables: `Apartments` and `Districts`, along with the sample records mentioned before.

If you don't like the name `Apartment Hunting`, or you'd simply like to change it, click on it and a pop-up with several options will appear. In there, you can choose to change the base's name, color, icon, and description (note several other options which are not relevant for this insight).

Here's how we changed some of the settings mentioned above:

The same process can be applied to tables and columns, and in this way you can fully customize the template to fit your requirements.
