# Using a Template

---
## Content

Suppose you are looking to move house and would like to keep some data on the houses you visit or consider. You remember that you saw a template named [apartment hunting](https://airtable.com/templates/everyday-life/expPfTzGnfpwjgWlS/apartment-hunting), and decided to give it a try.

Initially, you see the presentation page of the template which contains a short description and a preview of the base:

If the template is good for your project, clicking `'Use template'` will add it to your workspace.
