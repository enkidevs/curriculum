# What Are Templates?

---
## Content

Checking out the available templates on Airtabe is always a good starting point for those getting to know the product.

A template is a base that has already been created **with a specific purpose in mind**. They help you get started quickly, and if your requirements are different to the default you can always update the base.

Feel free to explore the [templates page](https://airtable.com/templates) which lets you search directly by name or by choosing a category.

Some template examples include:
- [Project planning with Gantt](https://airtable.com/templates/project-management/exptRCzoncS1Sjsf0/project-planning-with-gantt)
- [Content calendar](https://airtable.com/templates/featured/exp3FNmOkdHZvprXB/content-calendar)
- [User research](https://airtable.com/templates/featured/expwA47rLvwTu3SiF/user-research)
- and many more...
