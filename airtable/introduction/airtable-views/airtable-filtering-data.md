# Filtering Data

---
## Content

Creating new views can prove useful in many scenarios, but Airtable is not limited to that. Another important feature is the possibility to **filter data** (depending on predefined criteria).

> Filters don't change the data in the table; they simply hide some of the records.

A filter can be applied to any field, and depending on the field, it can have different options. Here are some filter examples, grouped by field type:
- **Text fields**
  - Field contains/doesn't contain the inputted text
  - Field is/isn't the same as the entered text
  - Field is/isn't empty
- **Single select**
  - Field is/isn't the same as the entered option
  - Field is any of the entered options
- **Numbers**
  - Field is/isn't the entered number
  - Field is greater/lower than the entered number

Filters are not limited to these field types; the above represent an example meant to point out the power of filters.

Filters can be used to create new views, or they can be applied to views that have been already created. It's up to you how you use them.
