# Multiple Views


---

## Content

So far we've only worked with one view. But in real applications you'll encounter tables with multiple views. Let's take another look at the previous example. We created a view of Catalin; or to be more specific we updated the default view to display only Catalin's tasks.

To re-create the main view, click on `Catalin's view`, and select the option that adds a new grid view. While you're at it, also rename it `Main View`.

Following the same procedure as in the previous insight, you can now create personalized views for Mihai, Andrei, or any other team member.

That's it! You now have a table to hold your tasks, assign them to team members, and each has their personalized view.
