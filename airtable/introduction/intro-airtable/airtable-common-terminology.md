# Common Terminology

---
## Content

Before you start working with Airtable, let's go through some of the most common terminology.

A reminder of the common spreadsheet terms:
- **cell**
  - the intersection between a row and a column
- **column**
  - these are vertical cells
- **row**
  - these are horizontal cells

And here are the Airtable-specific terms:
- **workspace**
  - think of a workspace as a collection of your projects
  - for example, you can have a workspace for your taxes and a different one for your application
- **table**
  - a table is comprised of cells, rows and columns
  - think of a table as a spreadsheet
- **base**
  - no prize for guessing: base comes from database
  - a database can have multiple tables
  - think of a base as a worksheet in Excel/Google Sheets

Now that you've familiarized yourself with the terminology, you're ready to start working with Airtable.
