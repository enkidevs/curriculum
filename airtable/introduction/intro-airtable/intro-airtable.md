# What's Airtable?


---

## Content

Airtable is a popular tool that works like a spreadsheet but gives the power of a database to organize everything.

Airtable can be used as a simple spreadsheet, but unlike Excel or Google Sheets, most of its power comes from being able to **introduce multiple data types in a cell** (like documents, images, etc).

Another advantage that Airtable has over traditional spreadsheets is that you can group rows by their values and link different data tables together.

Airtable can be used as a personal spreadsheet, for a small project, or even as a production database for your application.
