# Linking Tables 2


---

## Content

Working with the same base related to movies, you now want to keep record of all the tickets sold to the movies. To achieve this, you'll create a new table from a linked field.

Same as before: you start by creating a new field. This time you can name it `Tickets Sold`. When selecting the type, you should now choose the `Link to another record` option. When it comes to choosing which record, select `Create a new table`.

You've now created a new table (named `Tickets Sold`) which is linked to the `Movies` table. This table is editable: you can add any fields you want. You just have to be sure not to change the type of the linked field.
