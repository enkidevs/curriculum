# Linking Tables 1

---
## Content

Linking two tables is as easy as creating a new field. Going back to the previous example, before the tables were linked they looked something like this:

To link these tables, you have to create a new field, and when choosing the type you'll have three options related to linking:
- Link to another record
- Link to Directors
- Link to Movies

Suppose we're in the `Movies` table. To link both tables (and all the records inside), create a new field named `Director` (or anything else you want) and as a type choose the `Link to Directors` option.

That's it! You've now linked both tables. Notice how a new field named `Movies` appears in the `Directors` table. This is due to the dual nature of linking.

Adding data to the linked fields is done by clicking on the `+` sign found in the linked field, and selecting the record you want.

## Practice

To link two already existing tables you have to ???.

* create a new field and select the `'Link <name of table to be linked>`
* create a new base and link it using base linking
* delete the table and create a new table from scratch
