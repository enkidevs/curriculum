# Verifying the Ledger


---

## Content

For the sake of simplicity, we'll tackle the main steps of the verification process of Bitcoin ledger. For more complex operations, such as working with multi-signature accounts, storing records or running code, the verification process will require more variables to be considered.

To append a new block to a transaction-based blockchain, there are verifications conducted on two levels:   	

- Transaction level verifications
  - Check if there are enough funds to complete the transaction
  - Check for double-spend
- Block level verification
  - Check block references
