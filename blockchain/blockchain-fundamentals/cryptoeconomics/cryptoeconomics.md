# Cryptoeconomics


---

## Content

Technically, **cryptoeconomics** is the study of incentive mechanisms that are applicable to a cryptographically secure and distributed environment. In other words, it refers to a system in which past messages are verified through cryptography, while economic incentives and punishments are used to encourage the long term holding of properties and reduce the malevolent behavior.

The resulting digital economies are governed by computer code. However, much like a regular economy, they still require definitions for policies, may them be fiscal, monetary or privacy-related. Moreover, they also need the platform maintainers, that would update the protocols overtime in response to changes or needs.

The subject is vast and a solution is far from being platform agnostic.
