# Why Is the Price Fluctuating so Much?


---

## Content

In terms of the actual price (a coin's value in a certain fiat currency), no one can predict it exactly: who would have hoped that a bitcoin would reach $20,000?

In total, cryptocurrencies' market cap approached 1 trillion in December 2017. Bitcoin's market cap never exceeded $320 billions. Bitcoin traded volume was way smaller: maybe $20 billions on all exchanges corroborated, during peaks. In other words, it would be easy for someone that owns a relevant % of the total number of coins to manipulate the price in either directions. If the tendency of the market is to drive the price down, it's called a bear market. A bull market is the opposite: prices are going up.

It's hard to have stability when most cryptocurrencies have no commodity or governmental back-up. Only lately had platforms started to appear (read ERC20 tokens vs Bitcoin forks) for which their coins can be exchanged for a service, hence creating their own small economy. This is similar to how forex markets (where currencies are traded for one another) represent the economy of the countries: USD as the economy of USA and GBP as the economy of Great Britain.

Moreover, there are no regulations: pump and dumps, inside trading or other (normally illegal) methods of price manipulation/prediction are not punished.

Of course, markets in general cannot be explained in 5 minutes and many other things can be said about how cryptocurrency markets work. Given the how broad and unpredictable the topic is, self-study is required in order to understand all the mechanisms.
