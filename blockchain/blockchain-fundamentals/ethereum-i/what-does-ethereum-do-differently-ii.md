# What Else Does Ethereum Do Differently?


---

## Content

Ethereum is different than Bitcoin in many ways. It has an account model, special transactions, a programming language (called Solidity) and token standards. In this insight we'll take a look at some of those differences.

### Solidity

**Solidity** is Ethereum's most popular programming language. All you have to do is throw some Solidity code (similar to JavaScript in syntax) into a `.sol` file and deploy the smart contract on the blockchain. There are a few tools you can use, but probably the easiest to set-up is `Remix`[1] compiler.

Another language that is supported by the EVM is Vyper, similar in structure and syntax to Python.

### Token Standards

Another feature of Ethereum is **token standards**: an interface for cryptocurrencies recognized by the Ethereum blockchain. The most notable token standard is ERC20. But why would you use the standard instead of releasing a blockchain of your own? Well, having to find people to mine/stake your blockchain and low adoption are the main reasons new blockchains fail.

Moreover, Ethereum became a decentralized crowdfunding platform: you could launch your own project right away and ask people that own ether to sponsor it in exchange for your tokens ("stock").
