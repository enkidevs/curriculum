# Initial Coin Offerings


---

## Content

Now that you know of token standards, it is easier to explain how ICOs work. **ICO**s, or Initial Coin Offerings, are crowdfunding campaigns that are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

Companies that want to raise capital create such a campaign in exchange for which they offer tokens, or coins. These coins represent shares in their company, much like it works in the stock market.

Bear in mind that much like the stock market, the shares are worthless unless the company went public, i.e. their token can be found on an exchange.

Given the hype and fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) born over the wild growth period that was November-December 2017, a lot of scam ICOs were launched. Due diligence and proper research are required if you're looking to invest in ICOs.
