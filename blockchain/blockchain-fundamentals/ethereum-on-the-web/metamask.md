# MetaMask


---

## Content

Like for bitcoins, you need a wallet to be able to hold any ether. The Ethereum client works well as an online wallet if you are looking to also run a node. But, as any client, it requires you to sync to the latest block.

**MetaMask** is a browser extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum network without having to download the entire chain locally. It connects to an already running client that makes initiating and receiving transactions easy. Moreover, it supports any ERC20 token (standards for the win!) alongside ETH.

It is a simple interface that stores any generated keys offline, on your computer. With MetaMask, you can access websites that interact with the Ethereum blockchain in any browser that supports the extension.
