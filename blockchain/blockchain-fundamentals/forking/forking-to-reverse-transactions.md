# Forking to Reverse Transactions


---

## Content

Ethereum found itself in a rough spot after the DAO heist: the initial soft-fork that froze the thief's wallet was followed by a hard-fork that modified the smart contract and allowed investors to withdraw their ETH.

But a part of the community was not in agreement with the hard-fork. They strongly believed that the blockchain should be immutable unless attacked and no one should tamper with it, not even the majority.

As such, a part of the minority decided not to upgrade and continue building on the old chain under the name of *Ethereum Classic*.
