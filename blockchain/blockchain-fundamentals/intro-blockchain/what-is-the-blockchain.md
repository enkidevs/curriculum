# What Is a Blockchain?


---

## Content

A **blockchain** (a literal chain of blocks) is, in simple terms, a specific implementation of a *distributed ledger*[1]. 

This means that the data is in a database shared across a network of computers.

A very important property of the blockchain is its resistance to change. Once data has been added to it, it's very difficult to change it.

This resistance to change helps to achieve the core benefit of the blockchain: **enabling decentralized trust**.

Another important feature of the blockchain is **anonymity**. Only your wallet address[2] is stored. As long as there is no link between this and your identity, your transactions are anonymous.

There are many applications of the blockchain, such as:

- transactions (bitcoin, digital currency)
- government (storing public records)
- healthcare (digitized records that were previously stored on-site could benefit)
- supply chains
- and many more...

## Footnotes

[1:Distributed Ledger]
A distributed ledger is a database that exists across several locations or among multiple participants.

Think of blockchain and distributed ledger in the same way you might think of Kleenex and facial tissues. The former is a type of the latter, but it has become so popular that it becomes ingrained in people’s minds as what the product is.

[2:Wallet Address]
Unlike a real address, this will be a long string of numbers and letters.
