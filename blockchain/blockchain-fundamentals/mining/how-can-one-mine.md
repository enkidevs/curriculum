# How Can One Mine?


---

## Content

Bitcoin's puzzle is computationally-difficult. That means that you need processing power to compute the double hash effectively. Back in 2009, mining using your PC's CPU was still possible. The reward at that time was bigger (50 BTC), but its USD equivalent was a lot less (under 10 cents/BTC).

People quickly realised that GPUs performed 50-100x times better than CPUs. But GPUs are better at handling memory-hard puzzles and specialized hardware started coming out on the market: FPGAs, or field-programmable gate arrays.

The increase in Bitcoin price made mining a highly profitable field. Many companies invested in finding new hardware that would give people the edge over others. As such, a new industry that produced ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) emerged.

The most expensive ASIC has a hash rate of `13.5 TH/s` and it sells for $3,000. Latest generation CPUs can perform at most couple hundreds hashes per second (200-300 H/s), which means the ASIC is *40 trillion times* faster.

The problem is ASICs take a long time to ship. Some people even think that the producers use them to mine bitcoins before sending them to users. And by the time they reach the customers, they aren’t as effective as they might have been because the network's processing power is only increasing over time.
