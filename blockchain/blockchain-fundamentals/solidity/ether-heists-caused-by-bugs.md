# Ether Heists Cause by Bugs


---

## Content

Ethereum found itself in a rough spot after theDAO heist: the initial soft-fork that froze the thief's wallet was followed by a hard-fork that modified the smart contract and allowed investors to withdraw their ETH.

DAO means Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAO's goal is to digitize the decision making process of an organization, effectively creating a completely decentralized environment. In other words, a DAO is a smart contract that could work as an investment fund: people store ether and each month they vote for a project to invest in. The returns are then split by the weight of each investment.

That is how theDAO was supposed to function: a fully decentralized crowdfunding platform. The project was such a success that it managed to gather around 15% of all ether available at that date. ($150 mil at an average market cap of $940 mil in May 2016). But everything went down when an exploit that would withdraw the someone's invested ether before updating the total balance was discovered.

In total, $70 millions worth of ether were stolen. Faced with a tough situation, Ethereum Foundation decided to hard-fork such that all funds could be returned. But a part of the minority strongly believed that the blockchain should be immutable. As such, they decided not to upgrade and continue building on the old chain under the name of *Ethereum Classic*.
