# Blocks


---

## Content

**Blocks** are the structural components of the blockchain. They exist, no matter what problem the blockchain solves. The piece of information that goes in a block is usually called a *transaction*.

In a payment system, a transaction will contain a sender, a recipient and a transaction value. In a domain name registration service, a buyer, the domain bought and the value of the domain will most likely be recorded. The data in a block that stores decentralized applications will most likely be the code. In other words, any application will have its own transaction type.

We've got data that goes in the block, now we need the link between them. We also need a way to ensure that once a block is in a blockchain it can’t be modified - such that a simple reference to its position in the blockchain would not be enough. This is where **cryptographic hash functions** come into play.
