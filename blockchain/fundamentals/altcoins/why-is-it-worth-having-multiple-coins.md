# Why Is It Worth Having Multiple Coins?

## Content

Altcoins represent competition and competition is always good. It drives change and it allows people to find something they actually believe in.
             	
It also means that you don't have to necessarily build everything from scratch anymore. You can use and build upon existing code. And since Ethereum, the process is faster and simpler.
             	
The blockchain has that distributed, open-source culture to the point where "decentralization" becomes the antithesis of "secrecy". If a new blockchain-related company catches your eye, you should always be looking for their white-paper, in which you can usually find the reasoning behind and goal of the project.
             	
By researching those that succeeded in a competitive market makes it easier to spot those projects that are only built to be a scam. As it was the case with BitConnect recently, the hype and the fear of missing out can lead to bad decision-making. A strong community is more likely to filter out potential harmful agents.
                 
One of the biggest concerns right now is the rise of ICOs that receive hundreds of millions in crowdfunding campaigns only to die a quick death. Based solely on their whitepapers as foundation, which, without any regulation, means that there is no insurance the project will actually become reality. So, if anything, helping the ecosystem through crowdfunding is encouraged and may even pay off in the future, but always research the team and the progress of the project, and read the whitepaper yourself.

## Revision
