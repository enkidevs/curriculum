# Anonymity

## Content

There's a saying that goes "anonymity loves company". If you are the only one to buy a laptop on a certain day, then a transaction is surely yours. But if 10 different people made the same purchase, yours suddenly becomes harder to trace.
             	
The same is true for any blockchain. The more people using the network, the harder (but not impossible) it is to track individual addresses. Notice that we are not necessarily talking about identifying the person (which is also possible), but rather linking transactions together.
             	
Regarding Bitcoin, we can talk about a *pseudoanonymity*. Say you were the recipient of two transactions in
the past, two UTXOs of 1 and 2 bitcoins, respectively. Now, if you are looking to sell more than 2 bitcoins at the same time, you would have to consume both UTXOs.
        	     
Unless you are the owner of the addresses, you wouldn't be able to digitally sign the transaction combining them. Hence, we can guess that they belong to the same user/wallet. Your identity wasn't revealed, but your transactions can now be tracked.
