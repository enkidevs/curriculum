# Consensus

---
## Content

Consider the following scenario: you and your friends want to go out for coffee but you are having a hard time deciding where. You all have loyalty cards for different coffee shops (say you receive a free 6th coffee), so everyone is incentivized to voice their opinion.
             	
You could split, buy your desired coffee and meet later - but you won't be able to chit-chat over coffee anymore. Being all equal, you must reach a **consensus**. What if you race 100m and the winner picks the place? What if you promise to pay for their coffee if your friends don't enjoy it? What if one of the option is Starbucks, but you would rather drink a real coffee? How about agreeing to meet every week for a coffee at a different place?
             	
This is also the case for blockchain: there has to be a consensus about what conditions a block should meet such that the network accepts it. Consensus algorithms are needed to prevent *double-spending*. There isn't a singular *consensus algorithm* and they are rather case-specific. We will cover the most popular ones later.
