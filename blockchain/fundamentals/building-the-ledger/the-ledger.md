# The Ledger


---

## Content

The ledger, or better said "the transaction-based ledger", is a blockchain's *log of transactions*. As with any other ledger, the transacted object must be **uniquely identifiable**, under one form or another. Bitcoin, like most of the other blockchains, are gravitating around their only asset - the cryptocoin. Hence, the Bitcoin ledger will record bitcoin transactions.

Other types of ledgers include an account-based ledger, used by the Ethereum blockchain, or a combination of the two, used by the QTUM blockchain.

### Why are most blockchains built around coins?

Digital coins are easier to track. We cannot necessarily link one coin to an actual person, but we can track their movement. Digital coins (similar to any other currency) are commonly accepted as a mean to evaluate services, items, shares, etc. and it is in developers interest to also release a token.

Before money, it was something like this:

Since we now have a non-perishable intermediary, there's no need to count of the others to need what we have to offer when we need what they have to offer.
Having a mean to reward well behaved participants in the network, more people are incentivized to join. As more people join the network, the more secure and trustworthy the network becomes.

This way, blockchains are able to self-sustain solely based on the adoption rate.

### The Bitcoin ledger

The ledger is built to be **append-only**. If any other type of update operation is to take place (removal or modification), it usually means that the blockchain's security and integrity are compromised.

Unlike physical ledgers, if a transaction ever took place, there is no way of hiding or reversing it. Once happened and confirmed, the details of the transaction will be available to anyone connected to the network. This is one of the reasons the blockchain technology became so popular.
