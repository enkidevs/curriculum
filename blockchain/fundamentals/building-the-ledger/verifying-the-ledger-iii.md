# Block Verification


---

## Content

This verification ensures that everybody has exactly the same history: the hash of the previous block must be correct and match the end of the longest current chain. Ideally, the lookup should be done up to the genesis block. However, this isn't scalable.

In most cases, the network designates a checkpoint block, that is used as a definite source of truth.
