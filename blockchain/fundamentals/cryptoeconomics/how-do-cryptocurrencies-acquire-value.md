# How Do Cryptocurrencies Acquire Value?

---

## Content

In general, how do things acquire value? The answer is straightforward: they either serve a purpose/solve a problem (PC, cars, etc.) or enough people consider them to be valuable (currencies). The dollar/british pound/yen are useful because they can be used to buy food, a house or a car. Only humans and other living beings are intrinsically valuable since they can create value.
             	
Money is a concept created by us. Unlike bartering, it is way simpler to trade a chicken for coins and subsequently trade the coins for some wheat. A piece of paper on which you write $10 has no value, nor the one on which you write $100. Objectively, the $10 or $100 inscribed on the banknote shouldn't make any difference. But because we recognize some banknotes as valuable, it is a difference worth $90.
             	
That's money in general. With cryptocurrencies, the question is how much we value their attributes: global, intermediary-free transfers, trading speed, security, anonymity (in some cases) or the innovation they represent. Bitcoin can be transferred anywhere globally, in a secure manner and relatively fast. The number of products for which a bitcoin can be exchanged also influences its value. However, the Bitcoin blockchain usage is limited to being a ledger for its coin. Ways to extend the basic capabilities of Bitcoin are being researched but everything has to be adopted through community's consensus.
             	
Ether, on the other hand, powers the Ethereum network's smart contract system. On top of what Bitcoin does, Ethereum can also execute code files in exchange for gas. Gas can only be bought with ether (or rather its smallest unit, wei). As such, ether is used to pay for every transaction in order for it to be registered on the network. So, as long as you need/value what the Ethereum network can do, ether will also be valuable for you.
