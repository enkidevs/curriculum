# Why Is the Price Fluctuating so Much?

---

## Content

In terms of the actual price (a coin's value in a certain fiat currency), no one can predict it exactly: who would have realistically thought that a bitcoin would reach $20,000?

In total, the market cap in December 2017 approached 1 trillion. Bitcoin's market cap never exceded $320 billions. Bitcoin traded volume was way smaller: maybe $20 billions on all exchanges corroborated, during peaks. In other words, it would be easy for someone that owns a relevant % of the total number of coins to manipulate the price in either directions. Bears drive the price down in order for them to accumulate, while bulls strive to move the price up for them to sell.

It's hard to have stability when most cryptocurrencies have no back. Only lately had platforms started to appear (read ERC20 tokens vs Bitcoin forks) for which their coins can be exchanged for a service, hence creating their own small economy. This is similar to how forex markets (where currencies are traded for one another) represent the economy of the countries: USD as the economy of USA and GBP as the economy of Great Britain.

Moreover, there are no regulations: pump and dumps, inside trading or other (normally illegal) methods of price manipulation/prediction are not punished.

Of course, markets in general cannot be explained in 5 minutes and many other things can be said about how cryptocurrency markets work. Given the how broad and unpredictable the topic is, self-study is required in order to understand all the mechanisms.
