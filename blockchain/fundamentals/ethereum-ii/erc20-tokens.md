# ERC20 Tokens

---
## Content

**ERC20** is the standard used to represent currencies. It allows for basic account functionalities like transfer, get address balance, or get total supply.
             	
The basic ERC20 interface (that describes no implementation) looks like this[1]:
             	
```javascript
contract ERC20BasicInterface {
  function totalSupply() public
	  view returns (uint256);
  function balanceOf(address who) public
	  view returns (uint256);
  function transfer(address to,
	  uint256 value) public returns (bool);
  event Transfer(address indexed from,
	  address indexed to, uint256 value);
}
```
             	
And it was extended to include[2]:
             	
```javascript
contract ERC20Interface
	is ERC20BasicInterface {
  function allowance(address owner,
	  address spender)
	  public view returns (uint256);
  function transferFrom(address from,
	  address to, uint256 value)
	  public returns (bool);
  function approve(address spender,
	  uint256 value)
	  public returns (bool);
  event Approval(address indexed owner,
	  address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
```
             	
The basic functions are straight-forward. The `Transfer` event is triggered when tokens are transferred and can be listened to. An event has to be explicitly called in the function.
             	
The second contract interface extends the basic one with functionality to manage funds on behalf of users. One use case is having a second smart contract contain the logic that deals with token transfers. Like `Transfer`, `Approval` should be triggered at the end of `approve` function.
             	
Some information needed to define a ERC20 token is:
- address of smart contract
- total amount of tokens available
- name
- decimals[3] (from 0 to 18)

[3: Smart contract decimals]
`uint` data type can represent positive integers only, such that any balance in the smart contract would be represented in the smallest denomination possible of the coin (wei for ether). Decimals are then needed to be able to correctly represent the current balance. A balance of 15,000 coins with 18 decimals is a balance of 15,000,000,000 with 12 decimals and a balance of 15,000,000,000,000 with 9 decimals.

## Revision

Does the ERC20 standard define the actual implementation of the `balanceOf` function?

???

* False
