# ERC721 Tokens

---
## Content

**ERC721** tokens, on the other hand, are better suited for things you can not have 0.5 of, say cryptokitties[1]. ERC721 tokens are assumed to be unique and indivisible. You can only move them round in whole units, each one having a unique ID. They are known as *non-fungible tokens*.
             	
To better understand the difference, you can imagine that, while ERC20 contains an `address => balance` mapping, ERC721 contains an `uniqueObjectId => address` mapping. The ID must be generated deterministically and must also be a positive integer (most of the times - strings also work).
             	
The list of methods looks similar to that of ERC20 standard:
             	
```javascript
contract ERC721 {
  event Transfer(address indexed _from,
	  address indexed _to, uint256 _tokenId);
  event Approval(address indexed _owner,
	  address indexed _approved,
	  uint256 _tokenId);
             	
  function balanceOf(address _owner)
	  public view returns (uint256 _balance);
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)
	  public view returns (address _owner);
  function transfer(address _to,
	  uint256 _tokenId) public;
  function approve(address _to,
	  uint256 _tokenId) public;
  function takeOwnership(uint256 _tokenId)
	  public;
}
```
             	
Note: The ERC721 standard is currently a draft, and there is no officially agreed-upon implementation yet. However, you can find an example implementation in OpenZeppelin repository.
