# Forking to Create Altcoins

---
## Content

When referring to altcoins, **forking** has two different meanings. A source-code fork implies a new blockchain altogether. There are also hard-forks to create altcoins that share the initial blockchain's history up to the parent block.
             	
Let's focus on Bitcoin forks: in a previous insight, Litecoin was mentioned. Litecoin is a source-code fork, which has a Block 0 that is different from Bitcoin's Block 0. Over the years, multiple Bitcoin source-code fork altcoins appeared and, most of the time, inherently different from Bitcoin.  
             	
Blockchains are under constant development. New transaction types are added, scaling improvements are proposed and bugs are fixed. Usually, the community has the same idea about the future of the blockchain. In the rare cases in which opinions are clashing, a reasonable solution is to fork the network.
             	
The first Bitcoin hard-fork happened in August 2017, giving birth to Bitcoin Cash. The fork initiators did not agree with the Bitcoin Core team on what should be done to solve Bitcoin's scaling problem. Consequently, at block 478558, every wallet on the main network that had BTC also had an 1:1 equivalent amount of BCH.

## Practice

Identify what `cannot` be changed in the source code of a fork for it to be considered as a valid fork:
             	
???
             	
* Anything can be changed
* The coin name
* The mining puzzle
* The genesis block
* The estimated time between blocks

## Revision

What is it that is forked off a blockchain to create an inherently different one?
             	
???
             	
* The source code
* The state of the blockchain
* The source code and everything up to block X
* The nodes
