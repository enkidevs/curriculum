# Blockchain History

## Content

Theoretical blockchains go back to the early 90's, when multiple different projects were aiming to create fully *digitized, decentralized and securitized payment systems*[1]. 

Most of them never saw the light of day, and those that did were unsuccessful.

However, in January 2009, the first public blockchain was released - the **Bitcoin blockchain**. 

It was created by a person or group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto. More on this later.

What's important to point out is that, although limited in functionality, Bitcoin worked as a proof-of-concept for more complex blockchains. 

The *peer-to-peer payment system* pioneered by Bitcoin allowed forward thinkers to extend the concept to incorporate applications like crowdfunding, domain registration, prediction markets, voting, and so on.

## Footnotes

[1: Projects old as time]
Nick Szabo's proposal for Bit Gold is most similar to Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin, but it was never implemented in practice.

`DigiCash` was a company trying to create a fully digital currency with anonymous transactions but entered the market too early, before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet.
