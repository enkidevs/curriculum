# Why Should You Care?


---

## Content

Here are a couple reasons to why blockchain is an important technology:

1. **Secure**

All data found in the blockchain is secured using advanced cryptography. This makes it resistant to unauthorized changes (like hacking).

Because the blockchain is decentralized, it doesn't have a single point of failure. This makes it less susceptible to abuse, human error, data loss or hacking.

2. **Transparent**

The blockchain contains a full history of transactions, not just a snapshot in time. Moreover, the same history is spread across all blocks of the network, with all blocks storing **the same information**.

Another proof of the worthiness and capabilities of this technology comes from Estonia. 

This small European country started managing its registers, such as national health, judicial, security and commercial code systems - on their own blockchain. The system has been live since 2012 and their initiative is only moving forward.
