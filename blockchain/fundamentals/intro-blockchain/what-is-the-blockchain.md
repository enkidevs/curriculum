# What Is a Blockchain?

---
## Content

A **blockchain** (a literal chain of blocks) is, in simple terms, a *distributed ledger*. 

This means that the data is in a database shared across a network of computers.

A very important property of the blockchain is its resistance to change. Once data has been added to it, it's very difficult to change it.

This resistance to change helps to achieve the core benefit of the blockchain: **enabling decentralized trust**.

Another important feature of the blockchain is **anonymity**. Only your wallet address[1] is stored. As long as there is no link between this and your identity, your transactions are anonymous.

There are many applications of the blockchain, such as:
- transactions (bitcoin, digital currency)
- government (storing public records)
- healthcare (digitized records that were previously stored on-site could benefit)
- supply chains
- and many more...
