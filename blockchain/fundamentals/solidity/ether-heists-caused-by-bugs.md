## Practice

What was the outcome of the theDAO hack?

???

* Funds were returned through a hard-forked
* The address was black-listed through a soft-forked
* No funds were returned, but the address was black-listed
* ICOs are now illegal

## Revision

If coins are found to be stolen, identify what should be done to revert the theft transactions:

???

* hard fork
* soft fork
* ban the thief's address
* transactions cannot be reverted
