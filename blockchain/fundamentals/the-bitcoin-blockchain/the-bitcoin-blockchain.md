# The Bitcoin Blockchain

---
## Content

In the previous insight, we talked about people sending bitcoins to others. But where do bitcoins come from?
             	
Unlike real world currencies, that are issued by a country's central bank to meet a financial goal, bitcoins are part of a limited supply of 21 million. They are **created by the network** to **reward** the miner who appended a valid block to the blockchain.
             	
In a sense, they are created from thin air. But the steady rate at which they are created and the feature of having a limited supply make them a desirable asset. The **block reward** in 2009 was 50 bitcoins and it’s been halving ever since, every 210,000 blocks.
             	
A new block is discovered roughly every 10 minutes, so the block reward remains constant for about 4 years. The reward will be 12.5 bitcoins until late June 2020.
             	
So, for the first users to be able to transact bitcoins, they had to mine them first. In the early days, it was still possible to do it on your PC using the CPU. Nowadays, unless you have entire rooms filled with dedicated hardware (ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits), there's almost no chance of finding a block by yourself.
             	
But the extra dedicated computer power isn't helping with the network throughput[1], which is somewhere between 3 and 7 transactions processed per second. It is, however, helping with the security of the network: more people verifying transactions means a larger price to attack the network.
             	
Once people started trading bitcoins as currency, there needed to be a way to exchange them for fiat currencies ($/€/¥). As such, cryptocurrency exchanges were created. People could buy and sell bitcoins to one another and even trade them for profit.
             	
Bitcoin became a pseudo-anonymous way to donate to Wikipedia, Wikileaks and others. Vendors also started to accept bitcoin as a payment method, so you could spend your bitcoins on pizza or magazine subscriptions. But the highly volatile price and the network's throughput limitation meant that the actual value of the arriving bitcoins might not reflect the real value of the items.

## Footnotes

[1: Bitcoin network throughput]
This is the maximum rate at which the block can confirm new transactions. The number is constrained by the maximum block size and the inter-block time.
