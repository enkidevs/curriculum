# Wallets

## Content

Each Bitcoin address has two keys: a public and a private one. You only share the public one and keep the private one secret.
 	            
A (digital) **wallet** is a piece of software that can listen to and interact with the network. In case it is also connected to the network, it can handle transactions and display the sum of UTXOs that had as recipient *an address generated by the wallet*.
             	
Probably one of the biggest misconception people have about wallets is that your wallet is your balance on the blockchain. A cryptowallet is rather a collection of identities on the blockchain, each with its own UTXOs. Because of that, in general, but also in particular for Bitcoin, it is also recommended to never use an address more than once (we'll cover the reasons why soon).
             	
Usually, the main blockchain client has an integrated wallet as well (the possibility of generating private keys and computing public ones). Another feature that you must be looking for when choosing a wallet is its ability to encrypt the private keys.
             	
The encryption is necessary because the private key would be otherwise saved in plain text - not necessarily something you want if you have invested a large sum of money into the coin.
             	
There are also paper wallets. They are usually a printed page that contains 2 QR codes, that carry the public key and the private key, respectively.
                 
Physical wallets are pieces of hardware not connected to the internet that can run wallet applications. They usually require purchasing the actual device, but can generate new addresses, a feature the paper wallet doesn't have.
