# Robot, I'm Hungry!


---

## Content

It's Saturday afternoon, and you're ready for a grilled cheese sandwich ðŸ§€. Here is the recipe[1].

Instead of making the sandwich yourself, you remembered that you have a robot sitting in your garage that can do the job for you.

Let's write some code to tell our robot how to make a sandwich!

To get us started, start with the preparation of the ingredients first.

```plain-text
FUNCTION prepare_ingredients
  INPUT cheese, grater, bowl, bread
  INSTRUCT cheese_bowl = grate_cheese_in_the_bowl(grater, cheese, bowl)
  INSTRUCT sliced_bread = slice_the_bread(bread)
  OUTPUT cheese_bowl, sliced_bread
ENDFUNCTION
```

The function above is called `prepare_ingredients` and takes in `cheese`, `grater`, `bowl`, and `bread` as inputs and returns a `cheese_bowl` and `sliced_bread` as output.

`prepare_ingredients` calls two functions within its *body*:

- `grate_cheese_in_the_bowl` with `grater`, `cheese` and `bowl` as the input and stores the output into the `cheese_bowl` variable
- `slice_the_bread` with `bread` as the input and stores the output into the `sliced_bread` variable
