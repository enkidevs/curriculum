Welcome to your first Python program!


> 👩‍💻 Your task is to use Python's `print` function to tell us if you're ready to learn programming!


Here's how you would say hello in Python:

```python
print("Hello Beautiful People!")
```

And your computer would `print`: 

```plain-text
Hello Beautiful People!
```
