# Intro to Coding

---
## Content

If you want to learn to code, this course is the best place to start, before digging later into your language of choice. 

We'll cover the core features everyone should know before starting to program. And we'll emphasize a few key themes and tools that'll be useful as you learn.

All programming languages have a handful of building blocks. When combined, they can create any program:

- **variables** - to store information like `x = 5`
- **data types** - to differentiate between numbers, text, etc.
- **functions** - to make little blocks for different tasks
- **conditions** - to make yes/no decisions
- **loops** - to repeat tasks as we please

Every concept, feature, technology, or best practice beyond these basic building blocks were invented to help us mere humans manage the complexity of larger and larger programs.
