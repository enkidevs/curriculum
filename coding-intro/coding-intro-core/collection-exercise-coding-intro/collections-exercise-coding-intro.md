## Footnotes

[1: Print]
Printing usually refers to displaying a piece of text, a number, a collection, or something else.

To do this, you need to use the special `print()` function.

Here is how you would print the string `"Enki"`:

```python
print("Enki")
```

[2: Hints]

Here's an example to help you get started:

You can create a dictionary that stores the weekdays and their corresponding numbers:

```python
weekdays = {
  1: 'Monday',
  2: 'Tuesday',
  3: 'Wednesday',
  4: 'Thursday',
  5: 'Friday',
  6: 'Saturday',
  7: 'Sunday'
}
```


To access the value associated with a specific key in Python, use the following syntax:

```python
print(weekdays[1])
# Monday
print(weekdays.get(1))
# Monday
```
