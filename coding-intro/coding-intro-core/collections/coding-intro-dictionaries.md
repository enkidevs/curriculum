# Dictionaries


---

## Content

Dictionaries are associative collections that represent **key/value pairs**.

The name is inspired by our everyday language dictionaries, which are collections of word/definition pairs.

One way to write a dictionary is using curly braces (`{ }`):

```plain-text
// create a my_dog dictionary
// with 3 key/value pairs
my_dog = {
  name: "Artemis",
  age: 4,
  color: "yellow"
}
```

In this example, `name` is the **key**, and `"Artemis"` is the value.

## Practice

Complete the gaps such that the dictionary has `age` as a **key** and `33` for the **value**:

```plain-text
person = {
  ???: ???
}
```

- age
- 33
- key/value
- age/33
- key
- value

## Revision

Match the variable with its data type:

```plain-text
a = [
  1,
  2,
  3
]

b = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3
}

// ??? is a dictionary
// ??? is an array
```

- b
- a
