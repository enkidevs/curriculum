# Lists


---

## Content

A **List** is a data type that represents a sequential collection.

Usually, you can mix elements with different data types in a list, but some languages only let you use one data type in a list.

Lists items commonly have a direction:

```plain-text
item1 -> item2 -> item3
```

Which can also point both ways if needed:

```plain-text
item1 <- -> item2 <- -> item3
```

Sometimes we can see lists written using square brackets `[ ]`, with the values separated by commas inside.

```plain-text
users = ["Andrei", "Catalin", "Mihai"]
```

The above is a special kind of list called an **array**.

An array is a list where each item can be accessed based on its position.
