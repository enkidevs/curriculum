# Collection Exercise

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to:
> - **create a collection**
> - **access one of its elements**
> - **and finally print[1] the element**

It's up to you to choose which type of collection you will create and what data to store inside it.

> 💡 As a quick reminder, lists and dictionaries are both considered collections.

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[2].

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

> 💡 Take a look at [how you can format text using markdown](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/markdown-formatting).

> 💡 The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

> 🤓 Happy learning! Open the playground and start coding!

## Footnotes

[1: Print]
Printing usually refers to displaying a piece of text, a number, a collection, or something else.

To do this, you need to use the special `print()` function.

Here is how you would print the test `"Enki"`:

```py
print("Enki")
```

And here is how you would print a collection's element:

```py
print(my_collection[0])
```

[2: Hints]

There are many ways in which you can tackle this. For example, you could create a list that stores weekdays:

```plain-text
days = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday"
]
```

You could also create a dictionary that stores information about your favorite game:

```plain-text
favorite_game = {
  name: "Mario",
  rating: 10,
  played_hours: 86
}
```

Here is a reminder of how you can access the items:

```plain-text
days[0]
// "Monday"

favorite_game.name
// "Mario"

favorite_game["rating"]
// 10
```
