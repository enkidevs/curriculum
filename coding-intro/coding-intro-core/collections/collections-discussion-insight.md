# Test Yourself

## Content

Now that you started to learn how to code, it's time to apply yourself!

How would you create a collection and store some data inside it?

It's up to you to choose which type of collection you will create, and what data to store inside it.

Finally, access one of the items in your collection.

> ðŸ’¡ As a quick reminder, lists and dictionaries are considered collections.

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

When you're ready, leave a comment here with your submission. If you don't want to participate, you can always check the comment section to see what the other users come up with.

> ðŸ’¡ Before you submit your program, take a look at [how you can format your comments](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/markdown-formatting).

> ðŸ’¡ The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit, the implementation is up to you.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

There are many ways in which you can tackle this. For example, you could create a list that stores weekdays:

```plain-text
days = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday"
]
```

You could also create a dictionary that stores information about your favorite game:

```plain-text
favorite_game = {
  name: "Mario",
  rating: 10,
  played_hours: 86
}
```

Here is a reminder of how you can access the items:

```plain-text
days[0]
// "Monday"

favorite_game.name
// "Mario"

favorite_game["rating"]
// 10
```
