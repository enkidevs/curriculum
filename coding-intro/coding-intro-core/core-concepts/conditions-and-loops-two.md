# Loops

---
## Content


With loops, we can run a command as many times as we want, automatically!

Love that song? Put the `play` command inside a loop. 

```python
while i_want_to_listen():
    play_song()
```
> 💡 If you right-click on a YouTube video and click "Loop" you can see the video start over and over again.

Want to do the same calculation 50 times? Put the `calculate` command inside a loop. 

```python
for i in range(0, 50):
    calculate()
```

Any command you put in a loop will keep repeating for as long as you need it to.

The two most common kinds of loops are while loops and for loops. You'll learn all about them in the Loops workout!
