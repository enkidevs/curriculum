It's time to introduce the core tools for making logical decisions and repeating commands within programs.


### Conditions

In computers, there's no maybe. Every question is answered with a *True* or a *False*[1]. 

We can use if statements to only run code when a condition is true:
```python
if switch_is_on:
    turn_on_light()
```

> 😵‍💫 Woah...Don't worry if the code looks like gibberish right now! After a conditions workouts you're going to be a pro!

Here `switch_is_on` is a boolean variable. That means it is either true or false.
