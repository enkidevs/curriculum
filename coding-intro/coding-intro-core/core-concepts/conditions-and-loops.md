# Conditions and Loops

---
## Content

It's time to introduce the core tools for making logical decisions and repeating commands within programs.

### Conditions

In computers, there's no maybe. Every question is answered with a *True* or a *False*[1]. 

We can use if statements to only run a code when a condition is true:
```python
if switch_is_on:
    turn_on_light()
```

Here `switch_is_on` is a boolean variable. That means it is either true or false. 


### Loops

With loops, we can run a command as many times as we want, automatically!

Love that song? Put the `play` command inside a loop. 

Want to do the same calculation 50 times? Put the `calculate` command inside a loop. 

Any command you put in a loop will keep repeating for as long as you need it to.

> ðŸ’¡ If you right-click on a YouTube video and click "Loop" you can see the video start over and over again.

Could a loop continue forever? ðŸ™€

[1: Computers think in binary]
The language of computers is made up of only two letters, `0` and `1`.

Even though computers have such a simple alphabet, [they can still do incredible things](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3x7czk/eli5how_can_a_bunch_of_0s_and_1s_create/cy255mw/), like show you this text that you're reading right now.
