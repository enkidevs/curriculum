# Functions are programs too!?

---
## Content

Another way to think of functions is as mini-programs within a program.

If a program is the list of tasks for a computer, the function will be the instructions to do each of those tasks. For instance, a person's plan for the day could be the program; cooking, cleaning, and making coffee could be the functions.

A program is essentially the central function in which we use other functions.

We can even use functions as programs within our programs!

Perhaps someone wrote a smart program called `shortest_path` that calculates the quickest path from point A to point B. 

If we wanted, we could use `shortest_path` as a function in our new food delivery application to show the delivery driver's route.
