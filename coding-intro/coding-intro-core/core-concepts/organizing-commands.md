# Functions

---
## Content

Functions allow us to make little snippets of code, each for a separate task that we do within our program. 

For instance, we are simulating a human being that loves coffee, so much that he makes 10 cups a day. 

☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️

For every cup of coffee, he would need to do the following:

1. find a clean cup
2. boil water
3. open the packet
4. mix the coffee with the boiling water.
5. drink (gulp, gulp)

That's so much work! Instead, imagine if we had one function `make_coffee` with all of these instructions. 

Every time we want coffee, we write `make_coffee` and, voila! - the work is done.

Can you think of 3 other functions straight out of your everyday life?
