# Programs & Data

---
## Content

Let's quickly introduce the building blocks we'll cover in this course.

### Program

Today you woke up with a plan, a to-do list, which is essentially your program for the day. Similarly, we give the computers a set of commands to carry out, one after the other. That too is known as a program.

The only difference being that computers require specific instructions. (Don't tell anyone we said this, but machines are actually pretty dumb… sssh!)

### Data: Variables

Data is information and information needs to be stored somewhere. That's where variables come in. For instance, when you meet someone new you could store their `name = "Batman"` and `age = 24` as two separate pieces of information.

In this case, `name` and `age` would be the variables that store information.

### Data: Types

It's easy to divide 24 by 2 and get 12. However, dividing “Batman” by 2 might land you in jail. To avoid going to jail, we group information into distinct *data types* depending on whether the values they hold are numbers, texts, or something else.

These *data types* save us from attempting number related operations on texts and vice versa.

For instance, what is the square root of `cat`?
