# Programs & Data


---

## Content

Let's quickly introduce the building blocks we'll cover in this course.

### Program

Even though they're super fast, computers are annoyingly literal - you have to spell out everything for them. 

A program consists of one or more commands we're asking the computer to do. It's a sequence of specific tasks. A list of TODOs for the computer.

### Variables

For a program to remember values, it needs a place to store them. 

This is where variables come in. They serve as storage containers for data.

### Data Types

Computers don't always know the difference between `1` and `one`. Sometimes we have to help them out.

Using data types, we can mark data with a label that helps the program know the kind of value it holds, such as a number, text, etc.

This is useful because text doesn't have the same capabilities as a number. For example, what's the square root of `cat`?
