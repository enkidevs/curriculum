# Programs & Data

---
## Content

The two pillars of building software are programs and data. 


### Programs

Today you might have woken up with a to-do list, which is essentially your program for the day.

Similarly, we give the computers a to-do list of extremely specific commands, together called a program, to carry out.

### Data

Data is the information that our programs work with. In code, we store these in variables.

For instance, we could store someone's `name` and `age` in variables[1]:
```python
name = "Batman"
age = 30
```


### Types

Now remember, computers are extremely stupid machines! If you write a program to divide "Batman" by 2, it is going to try(and fail) to do that.

That's why we group our data into distinct **data types**, the three main ones being:

| Type    | Examples    |
| ------- | ----------- |
| String  | "Batman"    |
| Number  | 5,-0.5.     |
| Boolean | True, False |

## Footnotes

[1: What language is this?]
Every language has its own slightly different way of creating variables. The examples in this insight are all in python

## Practice

In the code below, raining is a ???, temperature is a ???, and forecast is a ???.
```python
raining = True
temperature = 42
forecast = "Today it is 42 degrees and raining"
```

- Boolean
- Number
- String
