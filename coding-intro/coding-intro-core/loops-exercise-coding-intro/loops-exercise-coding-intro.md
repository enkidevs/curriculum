## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Here's an example to help you get started:

Use the `for` loop syntax and the `range()` function to create a loop that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 10.
```python
for num in range(1, 11):
  # print
```

Inside the loop, print each number using the print() function.
```python
print(num)
```

When you run the code, it will print the numbers from 1 to 10, each on a separate line.

If you wanna print them on the same line, for instance, separated with a comma you can do:
```python
print(num, end=", ")
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
```
