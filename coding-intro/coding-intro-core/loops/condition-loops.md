# Condition Loops


---

## Content

Condition controlled loops are slightly different to counter loops. Instead of running until the counter reaches a certain value, you set a condition and the loop will run **while the condition evaluates to `true`**.

There are two types of condition controlled loops:

- the condition is checked at the beginning using a `WHILE..DO` loop
- the condition is checked at the end using a `DO..WHILE` loop

> 💡 In programming, you can achieve the same functionality in different ways. The same check can be achieved using any loop type. It's up to you to choose the method that you think is best.
