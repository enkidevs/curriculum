# WHILE..DO


---

## Content

The `WHILE..DO` loop is very useful when you want a piece of code to run **after a condition is evaluated to true**. 

The rule is that you **must** check the condition first, and only after that can the code run.

Let's take a look at an example:

```plain-text
hungry = true
sandwiches_made = 0

WHILE (
  hungry == true OR 
  sandwiches_made <=3
)
  INSTRUCT make_a_grill_cheese_sandwich(
    cheese, 
    grater, 
    bowl, 
    bread, 
    butter, 
    pan, 
    plate
  )
  INSTRUCT sandwiches_made = sandwiches_made + 1
ENDWHILE
```

We created a complex condition: if the `hungry` variable is equal to `true` **or** less than 4 sandwiches were made, you call the `make_sandwich` function.

## Practice

Complete this loop such that it runs only if `number` is between `1` and `100` (inclusive):

```plain-text
??? (
  number ??? 1 
  AND ??? <= 100
)
  ...
???
```

- WHILE
- > =
- number
- ENDWHILE
- FOR
- ENDFOR
- num

## Revision

In a `WHILE..DO` loop, which happens first?

???

- The condition is checked.
- The code is ran.
