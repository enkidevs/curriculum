# Let's Use a Variable


---

## Content

To get us started, let's say that we have the text `"Enki"` as our data, and we want to store it in a variable named `study_buddy`:

> 💡 Unlike human names, variable names cannot hold spaces. Common naming conventions for multi-word variable names are to use *snake case* (`study_buddy`) or *camelCase* (`studyBuddy`).

In programming, putting data into a variable is usually done with the `=` sign:

```plain-text
study_buddy = "Enki"
```

> 💡 Don't worry about the quotation marks around `"Enki"` for now. We'll explain them in the insights coming up.

Putting data into a variable is called **an assignment**.

> 💡 Assignment is usually done right to left. Using `"Enki" = study_buddy` will not work.

## Practice

Define a variable named `best_user` that stores `"You"`:

```plain-text
??? ??? ???
```

- best_user
- =
- "You"
- best user
- ==
- You

## Revision

In programming, putting data into a variable is usually done with the ??? sign:

- =
- ==
- <-
- <=
