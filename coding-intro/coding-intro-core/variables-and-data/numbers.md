# Numbers


---

## Content

Just as in maths, we can categorize numerical data based on their properties.

- we can have whole, or integer numbers like `1`, `999`, `-13`
- we can have fractional numbers or floats like `12.33`, `0.0001`, `-13.2`
- we can even have complex numbers like `13 + 2j`

In order to make everything easier and faster to work with, programming languages usually have different ways to store and interact with these types of numbers.

Let's define an integer!

```plain-text
my_age = 33
```

> ðŸ’¡ Depending on the programming language, you might have to type the data type before the variable name.

```plain-text
int my_age = 33

integer my_age = 33
```

## Practice

Choose the integer:

```plain-text
a = 1

b = "1"

c = "one"
```

???

- a
- b
- c


---

## Revision

Create a variable named `age` which stores `33`:

```plain-text
??? ??? ???
```

- age
- =
- 33
- "age"
- ==
