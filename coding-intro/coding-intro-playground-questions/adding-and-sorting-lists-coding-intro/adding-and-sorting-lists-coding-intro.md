# Adding & Sorting Two Lists

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **create a function that joins two lists and sorts the resulting list in ascending order.**

Sample lists to use:
```python
oddNumbers: [5, 17, 7, 63, 91, 55]
evenNumbers: [22, 10, 48, 74, 36, 80]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- order (`sorted`, `reversed`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`.append()`)
- list concatenation (`list1 + list2`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

[1: Hints]

You can use list concatenation and the `sorted` method or a `for` loop.
