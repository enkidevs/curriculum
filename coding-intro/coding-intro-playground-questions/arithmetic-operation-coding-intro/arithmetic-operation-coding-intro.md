**Note:** All Coding Intro exercises use the Python playground - it’s the simplest one to get started with!

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **adds or subtracts two numbers and outputs the result**.

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+ or -`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

If you’re stuck, you can always read this footnote[1] or review the comments section.

> 💡 The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

> 🤓 Happy learning! Open the playground and start coding!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two variables to hold your numbers. You can calculate and `print` the result on the same line.
