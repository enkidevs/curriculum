# Introducing Collections

## Content

Sometimes a data type is best represented as a collection of one or more data types.

Imagine you're writing a program to model a train. 

One way you would represent a train as a data type would be a collection of train car types.

Each train car type can further be a collection of passenger and luggage data types and so on.

Collections don't have to hold the same type.

Think about modeling a shopping bag. It can hold toys, groceries, and clothing for example.
