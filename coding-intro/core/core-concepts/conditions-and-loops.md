# Conditions and Loops

---
## Content

It's time to introduce the core tools for making logical decisions and repeating commands within programs.

### Conditions

In computers, there's no maybe. Every question is answered with a *yes* or a *no*[1]. Every choice with a *do* or *don't*.

Imagine that you were writing an app to control a lightbulb. The core of your logic would be a binary decision. If the switch is on, the bulb shines light, otherwise it doesn't.

> ðŸ’¡ In fact, the word `if` is the essential tool in most programming languages for writing conditional *yes*/*no* logic.

### Loops

Loops allow a program to do a command any number of times.

Picture playing your favorite song on repeat. The command `play` is looped over every time the song is finished.

We only have to write the command `play` once and then use a loop to repeat it until a user presses stop.

> ðŸ’¡ Loops let us repeat doing a command any number of times

[1: Computers think in binary]
The language of computers is made up of two letters, the `0` and the `1`.

Even though computers have such a simple alphabet, [they can still do incredible things](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3x7czk/eli5how_can_a_bunch_of_0s_and_1s_create/cy255mw/), like show you this text that you're reading right now.
