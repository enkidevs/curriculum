# Functions are programs too

---
## Content

Another way to think of functions is as mini-programs within a program.

If a program is a list of tasks for the computer, a function is a list of subtasks for one of those tasks.

In fact, a program is just the starting function that is using other functions.

This allows us to use other programs within our programs as functions.

Perhaps someone wrote a smart program called `shortest_path` that calculates the quickest path from point A to point B. 

If we wanted, we could use `shortest_path` as a function in our new food delivery application to show the delivery driver's route.
