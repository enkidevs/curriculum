# Organizing Commands

---
## Content

Functions allow us to group commands and create new ones.

### Organizing behavior

Using functions we can organize commands into groups and give each group a name.

For example, if you had a program that was meant to simulate a person going for a run, you might have a function called `goForARun` that makes use of the following commands:
- lift left leg
- lift right leg
- inhale
- exhale

The function `goForARun` would now be a new command in your program that consists of 4 subcommands.

### Sharing functionality

New commands created with functions can be used anywhere in the program, many times if needed.

For example, you could use the command `goForARun` anytime your user presses the controls to speed up their game character.

### Easier to read

Just like organizing a book by chapters makes the book easier to read, so does organizing your program into functions.

Functions give the program structure.

> ğŸ’¡ You should give your functions explanatory names to make it easier for the reader to understand what they do.
