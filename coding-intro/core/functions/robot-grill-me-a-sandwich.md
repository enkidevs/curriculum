# Robot, Grill Me A Sandwich

---
## Content

The robot instructions are almost done! We're getting hungry.

Let's do the part 3 of our recipe[1] now, the grilling of the sandwich:

```plain-text
FUNCTION grill_sandwich
  INPUT sandwich, pan, plate
  INSTRUCT heated_pan = preheat_the_pan(pan)
  INSTRUCT fried_sandwich = fry_the_sandwich_on_each_side(sandwich, heated_pan, "3min")
  INSTRUCT sandwich_on_plate = place_sandwich_on_the_plate(fried_sandwich, plate)
  OUTPUT sandwich_on_plate
ENDFUNCTION
```

> ðŸ’¡ We can give input values to functions directly, they don't have to be variables. If you notice above, we passed in the duration string `"3min"` directly into the `fry_the_sandwich_on_each_side` function.
