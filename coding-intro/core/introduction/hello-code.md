For the rest of this course, we'll use our own [made-up](https://enki.com/glossary/general/pseudocode) language to paint the picture of how programs behave and what you can do with them.

We'll be using a made-up language on purpose.

The point of every program we show from now on will be to demonstrate a concept. Don't worry too much about specific commands and focus on the big picture.

Understanding the fundamentals will enable you to pick up any real programming language later on.

When you finish this course and move on to specific programming languages, you'll be taught that language's [syntax](https://enki.com/glossary/general/syntax) but the concepts will remain the same.
