# Intro to Coding

---
## Content

If you want to learn to code, this course is the best place to start, before digging later into your language(s) of choice. 

We'll cover the core features everyone should know before starting to program. And we'll emphasize a few key themes and tools that'll be useful as you learn.

All programming languages have a handful of building blocks. When combined, they can create any program:
- **variables** - where data is stored
- **data types** - how to tell what's a number or what's text
- **functions** - how we can organize commands
- **conditions** - how to makes yes/no decisions
- **loops** - how to repeat behavior

Every concept, feature, technology, or best practice beyond these basic building blocks were invented to help us mere humans manage the complexity of larger and larger programs.
