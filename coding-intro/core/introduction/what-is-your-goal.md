At the end of this course, you'll have several options for the next step to take.

Here are some suggestions from Enki:
- Python is a popular language for beginners. It's easy to read, has a large community, and can be used for almost anything.
- SQL is a *querying* language[1] and a good option as a stepping stone to learning programming languages and analyzing data[2].
- If you want to start by making a website, make sure you go through our Web course (which includes HTML and CSS).
