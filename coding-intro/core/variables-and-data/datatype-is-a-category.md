# A Data Type Is A Category

---
## Content

You can think of a *data type* as a category for information.

Just like how in most human languages a "house" and a "skyscraper" are both in the category of "building", in programming languages a `1` and `0xff`[1] are both in the category of "number".

> ðŸ’¡ Don't worry too much about the strange-looking `0xff`. The core idea to focus on is that **programs categorize data by type**.

Most programming languages support at least some data types. The most common ones are:
- number
- text
- boolean
- list
- dictionary

There are many more types, (and you can even build your own!) but you'll start learning them as you dive into a specific programming language.

Data types are very important! They decide what actions you can and cannot take for a particular value. One example is that you can't add the number `1` to the text `"one"`.

[1: Hexadecimal number]
Computers commonly represent data using a hexadecimal system of 16 digits, unlike our everyday decimal system of 10 digits.

The 6 digits after 0-9 in hexadecimal are actually the letters a-f.

Using a system of 16 digits allows us to present more information with fewer characters.
