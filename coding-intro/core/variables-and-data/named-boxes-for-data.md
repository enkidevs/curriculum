# Named Boxes for Data

---
## Content

In programming, we store data into *variables*.

Think of a variable as a box for information.

You might put books, linen, microwaves, and so on into a real-world box. In the programming world, all those physical objects would be replaced by data.

If you had a garage full of boxes and wanted to find the one containing books, you'd probably look for the one with the label "Books".

Programs are no different. In order to distinguish a variable from another, we label it with a name.

This helps us know what kind of data is contained in a particular variable.

Make sure to use descriptive names to help out anyone (including yourself at a later time) understand what information is contained in a particular variable.
