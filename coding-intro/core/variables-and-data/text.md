# Text

## Content

In the land of computers, the text type is almost never called *text*. 

Instead, it is referred to as a **string**[1] (meaning a **string of characters**).

We've already seen this type before when creating the `best_app` variable. 

Now, let's make another one:

```plain-text
best_user = "You"
```

> ðŸ’¡ To help the computer distinguish strings from variable names, we wrap strings in quotes (`" "`). In some programming languages, you can also use single quotes (`' '`) and/or backticks (`` ` ` ``).

## Practice

Strings commonly have to be enclosed with ???.

- quotation marks
- parentheses
- square brackets
- commas

## Revision

Complete the gaps to define a string:

```plain-text
my_name ??? ???
```

- =
- "Andrei"
- Andrei
- ==

[1:String]

The term "string" was used to describe a sequence of characters before the existence of computers. 

When printing became available to the general public, companies used to bill customers based on the length of the print. This length was usually measured by the length of the characters tied with a piece of string.

About a century later, the term made its way into computer science where it held the same meaning, a string of characters.
