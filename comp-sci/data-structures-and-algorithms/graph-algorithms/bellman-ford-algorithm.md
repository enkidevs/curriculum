# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

---
## Content

**Bellman-Ford algorithm** computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the other vertices in a *weighted graph*. The difference between *Dijkstra's* and *Bellman-Ford* is that the latter, even if it is slower, works for graphs with *negative weighted* edges.

If the graph contains a *negative cycle* (the weight of the edges sum to a negative value) reachable from the source, every *walk*[1] around that cycle would decrease its cost - if this is the case, the algorithm should throw an error.

Why is this important? Because *Dijkstra's*, when run in such a situation, will never terminate as it will keep decreasing the path length by spinning around the negative cycle.

Like *Dijkstra's*, this algorithm is based on the principle of *relaxation*[2]. For *Bellman-Ford*, instead of visiting each node using a *closest-first greedy approach*, `|V-1|` iterations are done, where `|V|` is the number of vertices(e.g. for a graph with 5 vertices, the maximum number of iterations would be 4).

Because the implementation differs from one graph representation to another, the following way of applying the algorithm may not always work[3].

The algorithm follows a pattern:
- Instantiate two data structures, one for the *distances* between the nodes and one for the *predecessors* of the given nodes.
- Set the distance to `0` for the *initial node* and `infinity` for the rest. Initialize *predecessors* as `null`.
- `While` iterating |V-1| times:
  - `If` the node is *not reachable*, move on for now
  - `Else`, update the node's distance to the origin if the new one is smaller than the old one
  - Move on to the next node, until all of them are visited
  - Increment the while counter and start again
- You can terminate the algorithm earlier if the distances stop changing.

The *pseudocode* looks like this:
```text
function BellmanFord(vertices,
                     edges,source)
  distance[],predecessor[]
  for each vertex v in vertices
    distance[v]←inf             
    predecessor[v]←null         

  distance[source]←0

  for i from 1 to size(vertices)-1:
    foreach edge(v, u) in edges:
      w←weight((v,u))
      newD←distance[v] + w
      if newD < distance[u]:
        distance[u]←newD
        predecessor[u]←v
  // check for negative cycles
  foreach edge (v, u) in edges:
    newD←distance[v] + weight(v,u)
    if newD < distance[u]:
      print `Graph has a negative
              cycle`
  return distance[], predecessor[]
```

The algorithm runs in `O(|V|×|E|)` time, where `|V|` and `|E|` are numbers of vertices and edges, respectively. Swipe left for an iteration of the algorithm.

## Footnotes
[1:Walk]
Also known as **chain**. A sequence of nodes and edges in which there *exists* an edge between any two consecutive nodes,

In a directed graph, the ordering of the nodes must be consistent with the direction of the edges.

[2:Relaxation]
Assigning an initial approximate value to the distance (i.e. infinity), then replacing it by more accurate ones.

[3:Assumption]
We will assume that the *directed graph* is represented using a *nodes list* and a map with *(edge, weight)* pairs, for which a directed *edge from u to v* is represented as *(u,v)*.

The map would, therefore, contain pairs like `((u,v),weight))`.
