# Dijkstra's Algorithm Iteration


---

## Content

Consider the following undirected, weighted graph, for which **A** is the initial node:

The initial three steps required by the algorithm are taken: assigning the starting node, *A*, setting the distance between *A* and every node to `inf` and marking *A* as the current node.

The next step is updating the distance from **A** to all reachable nodes. In this case, every vertex is reachable, so we update the distance for all of them and mark *A* as visited:

If you prioritize the current smallest distance for the next node to be visited, **C** is the one to go to. Exactly as we did with A, we check C's neighbors and update their distances to A[1]. In this case, there is only D:

The distance from **C** to **D** is 3. This means that the distance between **A** and **D**(through C) is:

```plain-text
AD = AC + CD = 3+5 = 8
which is smaller than the old one
AD = 20
```

So, we update the current distance. There are 3 more nodes to visit (*D*, *E* and *B*, in this order), but we'll jump straight to the final state as the process repeats itself:

In the end, we are left with:

```plain-text
AB = 10
AC = 5
AD = 8
AE = 10
```

## Revision

One of the initial steps in applying Dijkstra's algorithm is

???

- assigning a start node.
- assigning an end node.
- calculating the final distances between nodes.
- marking all nodes as visited.

## Footnotes

[1:Paths]
If there is a path between A and C and one between C and, say, X, it means that there is also a path between A and X.
