# The Stack Data Structure

---
## Content

A **stack** is a collection of objects optimized for two things:
- adding items
- removing the most recent-added item first

The items are inserted and removed according to the *last-in, first-out* (*LIFO*) principle.

Imagine how you fill a steam cooker. You can add a tray of food on the top of the existing ones, but not in the middle, and only remove the last tray added.

In a *stack*, you are able to insert, or **push** items whenever you want, but you could only retrieve, or **pop** the top element.

### Stack ADT
Independent of any language, a stack data structure should provide the following update methods:
- `push(e)` : *Adds* element *e* to the top of the stack.
- `pop()` : If the stack is not empty, it *removes* and *returns* the top element.

And three other helper methods:
- `top()` : *Returns* the top element.
- `isEmpty()` : *Returns* `true` if there are no elements in the stack, `false` otherwise.
- `size()` : *Returns* the number of elements in the stack.

These are the available stack implementations in different programming languages:
  - `Java`: You can instantiate a Stack object through the `Stack` class. The insertion method is called `push`, while the removal one is `pop`.
  - `JavaScript`: There is no special Stack prototype in JavaScript. The Array prototype, however, supports the `push` and `pop` methods that replicate the behavior of a stack.
  - `Python`: The [`deque` class](https://docs.python.org/2.5/lib/deque-objects.html) can be used to perform stack operations. Another option can be using a `list` with the `append` and `pop` methods.
  - `C++`: Stacks in C++ are part of the `std::stack` library. In this case, elements can be inserted by using `push` and removed by using `pop`.
