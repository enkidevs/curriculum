# What is a Data Structure?

---
## Content

A **data structure** is a particular pattern for organizing information in order to make interacting with that information in the ways we want less expensive.

If this is unclear, let's fall back to an example: *clothes in a wardrobe*. Usually, there are two types of people:
-  Those who fold their clothes and **take their time** arranging them into the wardrobe, making it much **easier to pick** one out.
-  Those who **throw their clothes** into a pile and **deal with finding** a specific piece of clothing when they need it.

Both ways work to find your clothes! The first one requires more work up-front, but less when you need to wear something. The second one takes less time when it comes to storing them, but makes the *operation* of finding clothes in the morning more challenging.

This is the trade-off you have to think about when you decide which data structure to use: what is the operation I want to take advantage of?

Another example: consider a list of names written down alphabetically in a notebook. It is easy to find a name in the alphabetized list, but adding a new name to the list in the correct spot is time consuming.

Conversely, it's time consuming to find a name in the unalphabetized list, but easy to add a new name.

We might describe the respective *pattern* of information in these two lists as a "sorted list" and an "unsorted list".

Later on, you will be able to distinguish what data structure each example represents and how to use it efficiently.
