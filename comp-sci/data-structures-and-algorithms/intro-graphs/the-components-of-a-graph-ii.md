# More Components of a Graph

## Content

A graph is **connected** if between every vertex in the graph, there is a *path* (here's an example[1]). Below you can see a graph that isn't connected (you cannot get from *A* to *B*, for example):

A **directed graph** is **strongly connected** if for any two vertices, *v* reaches *u* and *u* reaches *v*. In case either one of `(B,E)` or `(E,B)` edges wasn't there, *B* wouldn't have been part of the strongly connected component anymore.

A **subgraph** of a graph G is a graph H whose vertices and edges are a subset of the ones in G. If H contains all vertices in G, it is called a **spanning subgraph**.

If a graph is not connected, the maximal connected subgraphs are called **connected components** of the graph. The only illustration of an unconnected graph above has two connected components.

A **forest** is a simple graph without cycles:

If the graph is connected as well, it is called a **tree**. A **spanning tree** is a *spanning subgraph* (a subgraph containing all of the graph's nodes) that is a tree. As the tree below contains all nodes in the initial graph, it is a spanning tree:

Note: The notion of **tree** here is not related to the one of the *Tree Data Type* since it *does not need* to have a root.

## Practice

Can a graph be a tree if it has more than one connected component?

???

- No
- Yes


---

## Revision

A subgraph of a graph is *spanning* if it contains

???.

- all the nodes in the graph
- all the edges in the graph
- all the connected components of the graph
- only the directed edges
