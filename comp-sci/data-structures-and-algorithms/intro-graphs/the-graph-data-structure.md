# The Graph Data Structure

## Content

**Graphs** are a way of representing relationships between pairs of objects. They consist of objects (called *nodes* or *vertices*) and the pairwise connections between them (called *edges*).

Graphs come in two flavors: **directed graphs** (*digraph*) and **undirected graphs**. In a directed graph the edges have a direction, like a one-way street. Conversely, in an undirected graph, the edges have no notion of direction.

This is how an undirected graph is represented:

In the above example, `A` is a node, and the line connecting node `A` and node `C` is an **edge**.

And this is a directed graph:

For example, *linked lists* are a special kind of directed graphs.

Graphs can be used to represent friendships on social networks. *Facebook*, for instance, is organized as an *undirected graph* (you appear on each other's friend list), while *Twitter*, is organized as a *directed graph* (you can follow someone without them having to follow you back).

There can be more *directed edges* with the same origin and destination nodes, and more *undirected edges* to have the same end nodes. These are called **parallel edges** or **multiple edges**.

A **self-loop** is an edge for which the 2 nodes coincide.

A graph containing both parallel edges and a self loop is represented below:

We call **simple graph** one that does *not contain self-loops or multiple edges*. The first two graphs are simple.
