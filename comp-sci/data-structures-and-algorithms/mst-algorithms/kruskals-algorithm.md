# Kruskal's Algorithm

---
## Content

**Kruskal's algorithm** is an algorithm that finds a *minimum spanning tree*[1] in a *weighted graph*[2]. The applications of minimum spanning trees are numerous: any type of network design (electrical, roads), data cluster analysis, process control, etc.

In other words, it finds a *subset of edges* forming a tree that includes *every vertex*, and for which the total weight of the edges is *minimal*.

The process of implementing the algorithm starts with creating a *set of trees*, also known as a *forest* (a way to store all the nodes in the graph and check if adding an edge between two of these nodes still preserves the tree's properties).

Then, a way of sorting edges' weights is needed. A mapping of *(edge, weight)* pairs, sorted by the *value* (i.e. weight) would suffice.

Because the algorithm chooses the lowest-weight edge first, it is considered a *greedy algorithm*.

Having these two data structures, the algorithm comes down to extracting the *cheapest* edge from the graph and adding it to the forest, combining two trees, if and only if it *does not* create a cycle[3].

The algorithm terminates when the forest becomes a spanning tree of the graph.

The *pseudocode* looks like this:
```text
Kruskal(SortedEdges[])
  Vertices[] // map of edge's weights
    // between two nodes

  foreach edge (u,v) in SortedEdges
    if !sameConnectedComponent(u,v)
      Vertices[u,v]←weight(u,v)

  return Vertices
```
The function `sameConnectedComponent(v1, v2)` checks whether or not there already is a path between the two nodes. Why do we have to check that?[4]

*Kruskal's algorithm* can be shown to run in *O(|E|×|log E|)* time, which is equivalent to *O(|E|×|logV|)*, where *E* and *V* are the number of edges and the number of vertices, respectively.

Swipe to the next insight to see an iteration of the algorithm.

## Footnotes
[1:Minimum spanning tree]
A **spanning tree** is a connected subgraph of the initial graph G, which contains all of the nodes in G and doesn't have any cycles. The spanning tree is **minimum** if its spanning properties are satisfied using the cheapest edges in the graph.

[2:Weighted graph]
A graph that has numerical values assigned to edges.

As the algorithm is using a greedy approach (sorted list of edges), we also know for sure the old edge connecting the second node to the rest of the connected component is cheaper than the new one.

[3: Trees and cycles]
A cycle is defined as a closed sequence of vertices (path): the start node and the end node are the same.
By definition, for a graph to be considered a tree it must:
  - be acyclic (have no cycles)
  - be connected

If the chosen edge creates a cycle, the data structure won't be a tree anymore.

[4: Hint]
If they are part of the same component, it means those nodes will already appear in the final spanning tree.
