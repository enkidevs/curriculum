# Kruskal's Algorithm Iteration


---

## Content

Consider the following weighted graph:

In order to apply the algorithm, we have to sort the edges by weight. Doing that yields the following ordered **(edge, weight)** pairs:

```plain-text
BC - 2, CD - 5, AE - 5
BD - 6, AB - 7, BE - 9
DE - 10, AC - 20
```

The next step is to "extract" the vertices from the initial graph and connect them. The first two nodes to be connected are **B** and **C**, by an edge of weight 2:

We continue with picking up edges and connecting the other nodes:

So far, so good. The next edge in line is **BD**:

Not exactly what we've been looking for. In order for a subgraph to be a tree, it must have **no cycles** - yet we got one, so **BD** is skipped. The algorithm will go through each edge in the sorted edge list until a single connected component remains. You can find the minimum spanning tree below:

## Practice

Is the following graph a valid one on which to apply Kruskal's algorithm?

```plain-text
           5
     A   C -- D
   3/         |2
  B      F -- E
           6
???
```

- No
- Yes
