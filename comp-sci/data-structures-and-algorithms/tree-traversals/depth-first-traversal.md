# Depth-first Traversal


---

## Content

**Depth-first traversal** (also known as *Depth-first search* or *DFS*) represents the tree traversal in which the left node's grandchildren are prioritized over the right nodes.

Let's consider the following tree:

Following DFS pattern, the order in which the nodes are visited is:

Which yields the sequence:

```plain-text
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
```

A full traversal of the tree takes  *O(n)* time and *O(n)* space, where *n* is the number of nodes. We can say the traversal is a *linear* function.

## Revision

Which node will be prioritized after *B* in a depth-first traversal?

```plain-text
         A
       /   \
      B     C
    /   \
   D     E
```

???

- D
- E
- A
- C
