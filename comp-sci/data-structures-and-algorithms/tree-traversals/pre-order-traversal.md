# Pre-order Traversal

---
## Content

**Pre-order traversal** is a type of *depth-first traversal* in which the visiting order is: root, left child, right child. It only makes sense for **binary trees**.

It works like this:
- *Modify/Display* the data of the current node (starting with the root).
- Traverse the *left subtree* recursively.
- Traverse the *right subtree* recursively.

For the tree below:

*Pre-order traversal* will visit nodes in the following order:

With the output:
```plain-text
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
```

The pseudocode for the recursive method is:
```
preorder(node)
  if (node = null)
    return
  doSomething(node)
  preorder(node.left)
  preorder(node.right)
```

## Practice

Chose the sequence that simulates a pre-order traversal of the tree:
```
      A
    /   \
   B     C
 /   \    \
D     F    E
```
???

* `A,B,D,F,C,E`
* `D,B,F,A,C,E`
* `D,F,B,E,C,A`
* `A,B,C,D,E,F`
