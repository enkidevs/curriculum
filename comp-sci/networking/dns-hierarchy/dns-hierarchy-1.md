# DNS Hierarchy
---
## Content

DNS servers are divided into three categories which form a kind of hierarchy. The three types of DNS server are:

* Root servers,
* Top Level Domain (TLD) servers, and
* Authoritative servers.

Root servers are responsible for having NS and A records for all of the TLD servers world wide. There are (at the time of this writing) only 13 domain names associated with root servers and all of them take the same form: `[a-m].root-servers.net` -- but these 13 names map to hundreds of physical servers by using anycast. These servers are considered the "top" of the hierarchy.

Top Level Domain (TLD) servers are responsible for having NS and A records for all of the authoritative servers for a particular "top level domain". A "top level domain" is the final segment of a domain name. `com`, `gov`, `net`, `edu`, `io`, and `co.uk` are all examples of top level domains. There are more than 1,000 valid top level domains. Some TLD's are grouped together and handled, for example ICANN operates the "generic top level domains" which includes `com`, `edu`, `gov`, `org`, `net`, and more. Local governments and NGO's also maintain some of the TLD servers. These servers are in the middle of the 3 layer hierarchy.

Authoritative servers are responsible for having NS and A records for websites and web services. Root and TLD servers are responsible for knowing about other DNS infrastructure; authoritative servers on the other hand are responsible for knowing about edge services like `google.com` and `facebook.com`.

It is the responsibility of the domain owner to operate an authoritative server for their domain (e.g. Google operates authoritative DNS servers for `google.com`) but most small businesses pay a company like Go Daddy or Namecheap to do this on their behalf. Namecheap, therefore, operates a single authoritative server that has A and AAAA records for many different websites.
