# DNS Hierarchy
---
## Content

DNS is a decentralized system with some centralized components.

For example, all of the root servers are overseen by an organization called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These servers are distributed worldwide to ensure that everyone can access DNS quickly no matter where they are. While these servers are overseen by IANA, they are actually managed and administered by other organizations that answer to the IANA.

The IANA also manages the groups that provide TLD servers and is responsible for selecting, auditing, and supporting those groups. Some of these groups are NGOs, some are government agencies, some are companies.

Finally, authoritative server are operated by organizations or individuals who own domain names. This includes businesses like Google who manage their own DNS; organizations like Go Daddy who manage their own and their customers DNS; and individual domain owners who can (like Google) manage their own DNS.

Although this system is distributed worldwide for convenience, it is possible to query any of them specifically regardless of your geographic location.
