# DNS Record Format
---
## Content

The first 2 bytes of any DNS message is 
called the transaction ID. This value will
be shared by the DNS query initiating the
request and the DNS response to that query.

---
## Practice

This is a hex-dump of a DNS response.

```
0000   ef 0a 81 80 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 
  03 77 77 77   ï............www
0010   06 67 6f 6f 67 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00  
  00 01 00 01   .google.com.....
0020   c0 0c 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 8d 00 04 
  d8 3a c0 04   À...........Ø:À.
```

Which of the following values is the 
  hexadecimal value of the transaction ID?

???

* `ef0a` (line one)
* `c00c` (line three)
* `676f6f676c65` (line two)
* `8180` (line one)
