# DNS Purpose


---

## Content

DNS is used *a lot*. It's rare for humans to memorize and use IP addresses for a number of reasons; as a result DNS is quietly invoked in a number of different contexts. Any time a program makes an internet request using a name (as opposed to an IP address) a DNS request is required to resolve the proper IP address.

## Practice

Which of the following actions NEVER require a DNS lookup?

???

* The terminal command `ping 1.1.1.1`
* Hitting enter in your browsers URL bar.
* Sending an email.
* Making an HTTP request to a web API in a programming language.
* Using the `curl` command to make an HTTP request from the terminal.

## Revision

When is a DNS lookup required?

???

* Every time an HTTP request is made.
* Every time an IP address is used.
* Every time a new computer comes online.
* Every time a domain name is used but an IP address is needed.
