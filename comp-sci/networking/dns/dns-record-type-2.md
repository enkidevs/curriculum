# DNS Record Types


---

## Content

There are many different kinds of DNS records. Among the most important types of record are:

* A and AAAA -- A and quad A records map domain names to IP addresses. A records are for IPv4 addresses and AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses.
* NS -- NS records map domain names to *other* domain names. Specifically they map a domain name to the name of it's authoritative DNS server.
* MX -- Similar to an NS record an MX record maps a name to another name. Specifically, an MX record maps a domain name to the name of its mailserver. An example of why this is useful: [john.doe@gmail.com](mailto:john.doe@gmail.com) and <https://gmail.com> both use the same domain name (gmail.com) but these two services run on different IP addresses, one for the SMTP mail server and one for the HTTPS web server.
* CNAME -- short for canonical name, this record also maps a name to a name. CNAME records are used to create aliases for the same service. For example you may want docs.example.com and documents.example.com to share an IP address, you can use a CNAME record to point docs.example.com to documents.example.com and use a single A or AAAA record for documents.example.com

???

* What is the name of the authoritative name server for this domain name?
* What is the IP address of this domain name?
* What is the IP address of the authoritative name server for this domain name?
* What is the name of the TLD server responsible for this domain name?
