# Types of networks

---
## Content

There are several types of **computer networks** currently in use, *characterized* by their **purpose** as well as their **size**.

The **size** of a network is inferred from the *geographic area* they occupy and the *number of devices* that are connected to it.

For historical reasons, the networking industry refers to nearly every type of design as some kind of network area.

Based on these aspects, computer networks have been classified as:
- `PAN`: personal area network
- `LAN`: local area network
- `WLAN`: wireless local area network
- `MAN`: metropolitan area network
- `WAN`: wide area network

### LAN

`LAN` network connects a *small number* of devices, being typically used in networked office buildings, schools or homes.

Due to operating in a *limited space* `LAN`s are usually owned, controlled and managed by a single person or organization. They also tend to use certain connectivity technologies, primarily `Ethernet`[1] and `Token Ring`[2].

This type of networks is usually characterized by **high-speed** communication and low implementation costs.

### WAN

`WAN`, as the term implies, it is capable of spanning a large physical distance such as a town, a region, a country or the entire world. The **Internet** is the largest `WAN`, spanning the Earth.

A network device called a **router** connects more `LAN`s to a `WAN`, resulting in a **high speed** connection as well, but with higher costs.


### WLAN

The term `WAN` is usually confused with `WLAN`.
A `WLAN` is a type of `LAN` that uses wireless technology (nearly always Wi-Fi) to connect some or all computers and devices to the router, and in turn a network (e.g. Internet).

## Footnotes
[1:Ethernet]
**Ethernet** is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in `LAN`s, `MAN`s and `WAN`s.

It defines wiring and signaling standards for the physical layer of other `TCP/IP` stack which will be discussed later.

Chances are you have already connected to a network via an **Ethernet cable**.

[2:Token Ring]
**Token ring** is a communications *protocol* for `LAN`s. It uses a special `3`-byte frame called a **token** that travels around a logical "ring" of workstations or servers.

This token passing is a channel access method providing fair access for all stations, and eliminating the collisions present in other access methods.
