# What is a computer network?

---
## Content

**Computer Networking**'s main purpose is to enable several devices to communicate with each other to share and exchange resources.

Network computer devices that send, route or receive data within a network are called **network nodes**.

Usually, nodes include **hosts** such as *PCs*, *servers*, *phones*, but also *network hardware*[1]. Two such devices are said to be *networked* when one of them is able to *exchange information* with the other.

Keep in mind that nodes can be **linked** with the help of:
- cables, most commonly the **Ethernet cable**
- telephone lines
- radio waves, enabling a **wireless** connection
- satellites
- infrared light beams    

Even though nowadays we take for granted that all devices can connect to a network, this wasn't always this case.
While modern devices have network devices integrated into their circuit boards, older ones counting PCs or XBox game consoles need a *peripheral* network device, such as *USB adapters* or *Network Interface Cards* (NIC).

At the same time, some devices can't connect to a network at all.

The largest and most known computer network is the **Internet**. This world-wide system of interconnected smaller networks enables millions of devices to communicate with each other.

## Footnotes
[1:network hardware]
These are physical devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computer network. Specifically, they mediate data in a computer network.

Such examples are:
- routers
- modems
- switches
