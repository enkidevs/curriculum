What are devices within a computer network

that send, route or receive data called?
```
* Nodes
* Gateways
* Modems
%exp
The term used for devices making use of a network is `node`.

A `gateway` is a specialized node used to join two dissimilar networks.

A `modem` is a type of hardware device that converts between analog and digital data in real time for two-way network communication.

---
```
Which of the following OSI model layers

handles authentication and authorization?
```
* Session
* Transport
