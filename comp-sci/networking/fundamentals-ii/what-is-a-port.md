# What is a port?

---
## Content

In *computer networking*, a **port**[1] is an essential component of the *Internet Protocol*. It is passed as a numerical value that identifies individual services on a networked computer.

A *web server* and a *mail server* can be hosted by the same machine, but they need to be assigned **different** port numbers.

While the **IP address** identifies a single machine, the combination of **IP address** and **port number** identifies a specific service running on that machine.

If you think of the IP address as the equivalent of a postcode, then the port number represents the house number
A building located at *249 Oak St.* might have a caf√© at *249 Oak* ***#1***, a bookshop at *249 Oak* ***#2***, and a so on.

The syntax used to specify ports is `ip:port`. If our machine is located at `13.0.0.0`, we can have a *mail server* running at:
```
13.0.0.0:9000
```
and a *web server* running at:
```
13.0.0.0:9001
```
To represent ports, a `16 bit` number is used, ranging from `0` to `65535`, yet the first `1023` ports are reserved for **well-known** application protocols such as:
 - `HTTP` with port `80`
 - `FTP` with port `21`

When you visit an address such as `www.enki.com`, you won't be required to also specify its port number.
This happens because the HTTP protocol, used to get the page, runs by default on port `80`.
