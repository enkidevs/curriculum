# Informational status codes

---
## Content

**Informational status codes** are three digit codes that begin with `1`.

The **status codes class** indicates a *provisional* response and was introduced in `HTTP/1.1`. Even though major browsers stopped using `HTTP/1.0`, there are still tools or web crawling bots that are trying to avoid the overhead required by the `HTTP/1.1` protocol. You should therefore handle those requests as well, in case you are looking to set up a new server.

Informational responses have the following content:
- Status-Line: `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue`
- optional headers
- empty line

There is no fixed number of how many `1xx` responses the server should return, so clients should be prepared to accept zero, one or more.

The three informational status codes are:
- `100` **Continue** - in case of the initial request being required to be split into multiple smaller-sized ones, the server informs the client it can continue sending the remainder of the request
- `101` **Switching Protocols** - the server informs the client that it will switch to the required protocol such that the message exchange can continue
- `102` **Processing** - interim response saying the request will take a while (more than a couple of seconds) to complete
