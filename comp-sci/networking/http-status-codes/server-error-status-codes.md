# Server error status codes

---
## Content

When processing *HTTP requests*, problems can occur not only on the client side, but also on the server side. In such cases, if possible, **server-error status codes** are returned.

You can recognize server errors by their first digit, `5`. An explanation of what caused the error should be included in the response message. This is not the case, however, for `HEAD` requests as they have no payload.

When encountering an unexpected condition preventing the server from fulfilling the request, a `500` **Internal Server Error** status code is sent back.

When a request containing a method not yet supported by the server is received (for example, using the `PUT` verb in a request sent to a server that expects a specialized `POST` request), the `501` **Not Implemented** status code should be used.

Other server-error status codes are:
- `502` **Bad Gateway** - returned when the server acts as a proxy/gateway and an invalid response is received from the upstream server
- `503` **Service Unavailable** - server is unable to handle the request due to overloading
- `504` **Gateway Timeout** - the proxy/gateway server didn't receive a timely response
