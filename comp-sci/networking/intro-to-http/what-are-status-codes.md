# What are status codes?

---
## Content

**Status codes** are 3-digit integers, part of the server's response in the HTTP protocol.

By using URLs and HTTP verbs (more on these in a future workout), a client can make requests to the server, which sends back a response containing the *status* of the request and a message *payload*.

The *status code* indicates whether the request has been successfully processed or not. The codes are grouped into *five* classes:

 - **Informational messages** (`1xx`): This class was introduced in `HTTP/1.1` and indicates that everything is OK so far and that the client can continue with the request.

- **Success messages** (`2xx`): These ones tell the client that the request was acknowledged and successfully processed.

- **Redirection messages** (`3xx`): These messages imply that further action must be taken to complete the request. Usually, they indicate that a different URL must be used to access the resource.

- **Client-error messages** (`4xx`): They are used to inform the client there was a problem with their request. The problem could be an invalid URL, a missing field or wrongly formatted data.

- **Server-error messages** (`5xx`): They show that the server failed to process the request.

## Practice

What is the first digit of the status code for a **successfully processed request**?

???


* `2`
* `1`
* `5`
* `3`
* `4`

## Revision

If the client gets a `5xx` status code, it means that

???


* the server failed to process the request
* the request was processed successfully
* the requested resource can be found at another address
* everything is OK so far
