# Differences between bandwidth and throughput

---
## Content

Both `bandwidth`  and `throughput` are metrics used to describe the performance of data transfer over a network segment (a link from a point `A` to a point `B`).

However, there is a big difference between the two:
 - `bandwidth` refers to the **maximum** theoretic amount of data (number of packets) that can be sent on the channel, regardless of practical considerations
 - `throughput` refers to the **actual** amount of data that travels through the segment successfully

This distinction can be better exemplified by:

A *highway* has the capacity of moving 300 cars at the same time - this is `bandwidth`. Most of the time, however, due to congestion or jams, the actual number of cars that it can move is around 200 - this is `throughput`. 

This distinction is relevant as **ISPs** [1] usually advertise their `bandwidth` which is often higher than the `throughput` you will receive.

These metrics are computed over a **single unit of time**, being expressed in bits per seconds (`bps`).

 Modern networks are much faster and therefore have their speed measured in millions of bits per second, megabits per second (`Mbps`) or in billions of bits per second, gigabits per second (`Gbps`).
