# Important networking metrics

---
## Content

**Metrics** are used to verify desired behaviours of processes in a *quantitative* and *qualitative* manner.

This is also the case in *computer networks* where metrics can help us identify underlying problems, enhance connections or even decide for the most suitable Internet plans.

The effective performance of a network is defined by the combination of different metrics which may vary because each network is unique in its nature and design.[1] 

However, there are some standard and relevant measurements applicable to any network:
 - `bandwidth` - maximum rate at which information can be transferred
 - `throughput` - actual rate at which information is transferred
 - `latency` - delay between sending a request and receiving a response
 - `jitter` - time difference in packet inter-arrival time (we'll get back to this in the following insights)
 - `error rate` - number of corrupted bits

Another important metric is `packet loss`, measuring what percentage of packets is lost while transferring data over a network.

This is not always applicable as **TCP** was designed to solve this exact problem, guaranteeing `0` packet loss.

However, in streaming media and online game applications - which use **UDP**, packet loss can affect the user experience.

[1:Measuring performance]
It's not mandatory to measure performance. Instead it can also be modelled and simulated.

One such example is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance using a **network simulator**.
