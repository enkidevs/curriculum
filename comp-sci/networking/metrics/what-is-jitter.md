# What is jitter?

---
## Content

**Jitter** is defined as the variation in the delay of received packets in computer networks.

Keeping in mind that while **latency** is the time it takes to move a packet from point A to point B, **jitter** is the *change* in that time.

Jitter, referred to as **Packet Delay Variation**[1], is an undesirable effect caused by inherent tendencies[2] of **TCP/IP** networks. It is measured in milliseconds.

Imagine a simple network between two computers, **A** and **B**. **A** sends a packet to **B** in `20ms` and **B** sends a response to **A** in `20ms`, then the flow of data is continuous and neither of the computers experience **jitter**.

However, this is an ideal case. 

Supposedly **A** sends packets every `20ms`, yet the router between **A** and **B** is busy handling other intensive tasks on the network (e.g. computer **C** is downloading a massive file). Consequently, computer **B** won't receive the packets constantly or evenly.

Following this scenario, instead of every `20ms`, **B** can receive packets with a delay (i.e. every `40ms`, `60ms` or more). This phenomenon is called **jitter**.

There's a pretty high chance you have experienced jitter before. Most recognisable scenarios are *lag spikes* in video games where players teleport across the map or *pauses in video buffering* on services like YouTube.

## Footnotes
[1:packet delay variation]
Keep in mind that the terms **Jitter** and **Packet Delay Variation** are not completely synonymous, but often used interchangeably.

[2:what causes jitter]
Common jitter causes in **TCP/IP** networks are:
 - congestion
 - improper queuing
 - configuration errors
