# Network Models (TCP/IP)

## Content

### `TCP/IP` Internet Model

The `TCP/IP` stack, pre-dating the model discussed above, is a layered protocol and is based on standard protocols around which the Internet has developed.

The four **layers** taking part of the *Internet` model* architecture are:

- `Application` Layer: defines the **protocol** which enables applications to interact with lower layers
- `Transport` Layer: ensures that the *delivered data* is in-order
- `Internet` Layer: responsible for addressing, packaging, and routing functions
- `Network Interface` Layer: provides the means for the system to deliver data to the other devices on a directly attached network

**TCP/IP** is the older of the two approaches to data communications and is well established throughout the world.

 The **OSI model**, however, is a proven concept that is used in all other data communications protocols. It will continue to be used as a guideline for all other communications applications.
