# Extended terminologies


---

## Content

**Computer networking**, constantly evolving, accumulated over time a lot of technical jargon that can be overwhelming.

It's better to understand technologies and common terms used by convention before digging any deeper.

#### Firewall

A firewall is a network security system that monitors *incoming and outgoing* network traffic and decides whether to *allow or block* specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

This system can be a software program, a piece of hardware of a combination of both. A firewall is usually used for:

- blocking access to **private networks** (intranets)
- screening malicious data that try to reach your computer over the Internet

#### Proxy

A **proxy server** serves as a hub through which Internet requests are processed. It acts like a middle-man between you and a targeted host.

A proxy will make the requests you want instead and will return the response back to you. It can be used for various reasons:

- bypassing parental filters
- accessing location-blocked content
- providing a layer of anonymity

#### VPN

*Virtual Private Networks* extend a private network across a public network, such as the Internet.

Nowadays, they serve as a security and anonymity mechanism when browsing public networks.

#### ISP

Short for *Internet Service Provider*, the ISP is usually the company that provides you access to the Internet. ISPs either own or lease the cables used for the physical connection between your machine and other network segments on the Internet.

#### Gateway

A gateway is a device that routes traffic between networks. For example, your home router is your gateway between `LAN` and `WAN`.

#### MAC address

Also known as *physical address*, this is a unique identifier designed to differentiate devices on a network. However, you can change (spoof) the **MAC address** of a device to preserve anonymity.
