# Tools to interact with Networks


---

## Content

We have witnessed an exponential growth in the size of **computer networks** since their introduction, with more and more people joining them every day.

It stands to reason that their complexity increased to provide faster, more reliable and more secure communication.

Due to this complexity, interacting with **networks** can be intimidating to numerous users.
Luckily, most operating systems, counting **Linux**, **OSX**, **Windows** and even **Chrome OS**, provide a variety of utilities to make these interactions easier.

These will prove extremely useful when having to troubleshoot, optimize or get various information about **networks**.

In addition, getting to know how the *tools of the trade* work will give you a better insight on how **networks** work.

Some of the most known and used networking utilities include:

- `ping` - tests the availability of remote hosts by echoing a packet to the destination
- `traceroute` - provides information about the path of a packet towards a destination
- `ipconfig/ifconfig` - configures network interfaces
- `nslookup` - looks up IP addresses linked to a domain
- `netstat` - provides statistics about networks
- `route` - shows and manipulates the **IP Routing Table**[1]

## Footnotes

[1:IP Routing Table]
A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in table format, that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (`IP`) network will be directed.

All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.
