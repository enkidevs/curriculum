# HTTP pipelining

---
## Content

**HTTP pipelining** is a technique in which multiple *requests* are sent on a single `TCP` connection, without waiting for the corresponding *responses*.

The server must respond in the same order the requests were received. Clients who assume persistent connection and pipelining need to be prepared to **reconnect** in case the pipelining process fails.

Pipelining dramatically improves the loading time of `HTML` web pages. Unfortunately, the current `HTTP/1.1` standard isn't the most efficient as it doesn't allow asynchronous operations. However, things should run much smoother after `HTTP/2` will gain enough traction.

Keep in mind that **non-idempotent**[1] requests, like those using `POST`, should **not** be pipelined as more of such requests will produce a different result than a single one. In addition, depending on whether requests in the sequence depend on the effect of other, `PUT` and `DELETE` request can also be **non-idempotent**.

HTTP pipelining requires both the *client* and the *server* to support it. Any server that supports `HTTP/1.1` should also support **pipelining** by default.

[1:idempotent]
In Computer Science, the term **idempotent** is used to describe an operation that will produce the same result if executed once or multiple times.
