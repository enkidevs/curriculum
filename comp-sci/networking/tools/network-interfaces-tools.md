# Network Interfaces

---
## Content

The `ifconfig` command is available on **Linux** and **OS X**. It enables users to configure and view information about network interfaces via the command line.

The **network interface** is an interconnection point between a computer and a private/public network.

Keep in mind that interfaces don't have to be in physical form (e.g. ethernet interface), but can also be a simulating piece of software.

Such an example is the **loopback**[1] (`lo0`) interface specified by the IP protocol:
```
127.0.0.1 // IPv4
::1 //IPv6
```

On **Windows**, the closest equivalent of `ifconfig` command is `ipconfig`, which works in a slightly different way[2].

To view all (active and inactive) network interfaces with their details the `-a` flag must be used:
```bash
$ ifconfig -a
lo0: ... (loopback)
en0: ... (physical net. conn.)
en1: ... (physical net. conn.)
fw0: ... (IP over Firewall)

```

Keep in mind that in **OS X** the `-a` flag is implied, while on **Linux** running it with no flags will only show *active* connections.

To show only *inactive* connections:
```bash
$ ifconfig -u
```

Specifying an interface name as an argument will limit the output to that specific interface.

Interfaces vary from distribution to distribution, for example: `lo` is used on Linux machines, while `lo0` is available on OSX.

An example output for the *loopback* on **Linux** is:

```
$ ifconfig lo
lo Link encap:Local Loopback  
   inet addr:127.0.0.1  
   Mask:255.0.0.0
...
```
You can also activate[3] or deactivate an interface with the `up` flag or `down` respectively:
```
$ ifconfig eth0 up
$ ifconfig eth0 down
```

```
$ ifconfig ???
```

## Footnotes
[1:loopback]
The **loopback** is a virtual network interface that a device can use to communicate with itself.

This is especially useful for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes or to connect to servers running on the same machine as the client.

For `IPv4`, the loopback interface is assigned all the IPs in the `127.0.0.0/8` address block.

[2:ipconfig]
For example, to display detailed, full configuration information, on Windows, the command is:
```
C:\> IPCONFIG /all
```

[3:activate/deactivate]
Instead of using the `up/down` flags, specialized equivalent commands are available(the same command is used on all distributions):

```
$ ifup eth0
$ ifdown eth0
```
