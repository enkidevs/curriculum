# Network Statistics

---
## Content

Short for *Network Statistics*, the `netstat` command is a simple, yet powerful tool that provides useful information about your network configuration and activity.

`netstat` is a collection of different utilities, invoked by different **flags**.

When ran with no *flags*, `netstat` will display **active internet connections**, just as running it with the `-a` flag.

You can limit what type of connections you see by **protocol** with:
 - `-t` (`--tcp`) for TCP connections
 - `-u` (`--udp`) for UDP connections

To get the **kernel routing table**[1], the `-r` flag is needed:
```bash
$ netstat -r
Routing tables

Internet:
Destination        Gateway ...
default            192.168.62.254 ...
127                localhost ...
...

```
Running `netstat` with the `-i` (Unix only) flag will output the **network interfaces** currently installed in your system.
```bash
$ netstat -i
Name  Mtu     Network    Address
lo0   16384   <Link#1>   ...
lo0   16384   127        localhost ...
lo0   16384   localhost  ::1 ...
...
```

Per-protocol statistics are also available with `-s` flag:
```bash
$ netstat -s
tcp:
   13348093 packets sent
   ...
```

The `netstat` is available on most operating systems including **Windows**, **Linux** and **OS X**.

## Practice

Which flag can you use to display the **kernel routing table**?
```bash
$ netstat ???
```


* `-r`
* `-x`
* `-i`
* `-u`
* `-t`

---
## Revision

What flag would you use to filter the output of the following snippet, showing only `TCP` connections:
```bash
$ netstat ???
```


* `-t`
* `-i`
* `-u`
* `-r`
* `-tcp`

## Footnotes
[1:kernel routing table]
This is the same as the **IP routing table**, mentioned in the previous insight.
On **Linux** the same information can be retrieved from the table using `route` command.
