What are devices within a computer network

that send, route or receive data called?
```

* Nodes
* Gateways
* Modems

%exp
The term used for devices making use of a network is `node`.

A `gateway` is a specialized node used to join two dissimilar networks.

A `modem` is a type of hardware device that converts between analog and digital data in real time for two-way network communication.

The first step of data transmission is

breaking down the data into
???
```

* packets
* nodes
* models

%exp

```text
A packet is made out of header and

???
```

* payload
* body
* datagram

%exp
A `packet` is made out of:
- **header**: special information needed by protocols in use
- **payload**: actual data of a packet

```text
Protocols can be thought of as:
???
```

* communication rules
* specialized devices
* linking mechanism

%exp
A network protocol defines rules and conventions for communication between network devices.

%

---

```text
Which of the following OSI model layers

handles authentication and authorization?
```

* Session
* Transport
* Data Link

%exp
While the `Session` layer handles authentication and authorization, `Transport` layer ensures data delivery and `Data Link` transfers data among adjacent nodes.
