# If Statements

---

## Content

Control flow statements, like the `if` statement, allow us to conditionally execute code:

```cpp
if (condition) {
  // execute this code
}
```

For example, this if statement checks if a number is positive:
```cpp
int num = 3;
if (num > 0) {
  cout << num << " is a positive number";
}
// 3 is a positive number
```
