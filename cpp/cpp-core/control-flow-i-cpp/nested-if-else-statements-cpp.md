# Nested if else Statements

---

## Content

In C++, we can also have an `if-else` statement inside another `if-else` statement. This is called nesting.

Here's a basic example:
```cpp
int age = 20;

if(age >= 18) {
  if(age <= 60) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult." << std::endl;
  }
  else {
    std::cout << "You are a senior." << std::endl;
  }
}
else {
  std::cout << "You are not an adult." << std::endl;
}
```

> ğŸ’¬ Can you decipher the code? What will happen if `age = 65`?

## Practice

What is the output of the following code?

```cpp
age = 70;

if(age >= 18) {
  if(age <= 60) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult.";
  }
  else {
   std::cout << "You are a senior.";
  }
}
else {
  std::cout << "You are not an adult.";
}
// Output: ???
```


- You are a senior.
- You are not an adult.
- You are an adult.

## Revision

What is the output of the following code?

```cpp
age = 15;

if(age >= 18) {
  if(age <= 60) {
    std::cout << "You are an adult.";
  }
  else {
   std::cout << "You are a senior.";
  }
}
else {
  std::cout << "You are not an adult.";
}
// Output: ???
```


- You are not an adult.
- You are a senior.
- You are an adult.
