# Char and String

---

## Content

`char` is used to represent a single character, such as `'a'`, `'Z'`, or `'2'`:

```cpp
char letter = 'a';
std::cout << letter;
// a
```

To store sequences of characters, also called *strings*, we first need to import its library:
```cpp
#include <string>;

std::string greeting = "Hello, world!";
std::cout << greeting;
// Hello, world!
```

---
## Practice

Complete the following code snippet by declaring a `string` variable named `name` and assigning it a value of `"Enki"`.

```cpp
??? name = "???";
```

- `std::string`
- `Enki`
- `String`
- `char`
