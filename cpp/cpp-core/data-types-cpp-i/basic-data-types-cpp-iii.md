# Int and Float

---

## Content

Integers are whole numbers such as `1`, `2`, `-30`, `9999`:
```cpp
int number = 10;
std::cout << number;
// 10
```


Floating-point numbers (`float`) are numbers that contain a decimal point.
```cpp
float number = 10.5;
std::cout << number; 
// 10.5
```
If you need to store your floating-point number more precisely, you can also use `double`.[1]

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet by declaring a floating-point variable named `pi` and assigning it a value of `3.14`.

```cpp
??? pi = "???";
```

- `float`
- `3.14`
- `pi`
- `int`

## Revision

Complete the following code snippet by declaring an `int` variable named `age` and assigning it a value of `17`.

```cpp
??? ??? = 17;
```

- `int`
- `age`
- `integer`
- `AGE`
- `double`

## Footnotes

[1: Double]

A `double` is a data type used to store floating-point numbers with double precision, providing approximately 15 to 16 decimal digits of accuracy. In contrast, a `float` is a data type with single precision, offering about 7 decimal digits of accuracy.
