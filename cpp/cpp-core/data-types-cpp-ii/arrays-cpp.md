# Arrays

---

## Content

An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by an index.

Here's how you can define an array:

```cpp
int numbers[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

In this example, `numbers` is an array that can hold 4 integers.

> Arrays in **C++** are fixed in size. If you need a collection that isn't fixed, you can use `Vectors` (more on this in the next insight).
