# Booleans

---

## Content

Boolean variables can hold one of two values; `true` or `false`
```cpp
bool isTrue = true;
std::cout << std::boolalpha << isTrue;
// true
```

The `std::boolalpha` manipulator is used to print bool values as 'true' or 'false'. 

If we didn't use `std::boolalpha`, the boolean values would be printed as '1' for true and '0' for false.

---
## Practice

Complete the following code snippet by declaring a boolean variable named `isTrue` and assigning it a value of `true`.

```csharp
??? isTrue = ???;
```

- `bool`
- `true`
- `false`
- `boolean`
