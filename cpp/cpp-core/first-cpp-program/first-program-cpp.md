# Let's Create Our First Program!

---

## Content

Ready for some code?

It's time to create our first program! 

`"Hello, World!"` is a simple program that prints the text `"Hello, World!"` to the screen. 

In **C++**, you can print text to the screen using the `std::cout` function. Here is an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}

```

Let's save that to a script file with the `.cpp` extension.
