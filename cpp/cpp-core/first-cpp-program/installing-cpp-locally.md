# Installing C++ Locally

## Content

To install a C++ compiler (GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection), you can follow these steps:

- **Windows**: Install Mingw-w64 from the official website. You can use it with an IDE like Code::Blocks or a text editor like VS Code.
- **Linux**: GCC is probably already installed. If not, you can install it via the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use the command `sudo apt install build-essential`.
- **macOS**: Install Xcode from the App Store. The Xcode Command Line Tools include a GCC compiler[1].
