# Compiling C++

---

## Content

When you write C++ code, it doesn't run directly; instead, it goes through a special translator called a compiler. 

The compiler:
1. Reads your C++ code
2. Translates C++ into machine code (which your computer can understand)
3. Creates an executable file! 

VoilÃ ! Your program is ready to party! ðŸŽŠ

> You'll compile your first C++ program at the end of the next workout!
