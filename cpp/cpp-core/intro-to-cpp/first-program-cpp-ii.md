# Let's Create Our First Program!

---

## Content

Assuming you named it `hello.cpp`, we can then compile our C++ program with:
```bash
g++ -o helloProgram hello.cpp # For Mac/Linux
g++ -o helloProgram.exe hello.cpp # For Windows
```
This will create an executable called `helloProgram.exe`
We can then run our compiled C++ code in the console with:
```bash
./helloProgram # For Mac/Linux
./helloProgram.exe # For Windows
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to your console!

Great work! You're well on your way to becoming a C++ master!
