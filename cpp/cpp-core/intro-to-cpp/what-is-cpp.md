## Content

C++ is a highly efficient, flexible, open-source programming language.

C++ includes features that allow more direct control over the system hardware, making it great for everything from creating operating systems to conducting advanced physics research! ‚öõÔ∏è

Here's an example of C++ code where we find out how many pizzas two superheroes ate combined:
```cpp
int spiderman = 3;
int batman = 5;
std::cout << "Together, they ate " << spiderman + batman << " pizzas!";
```
