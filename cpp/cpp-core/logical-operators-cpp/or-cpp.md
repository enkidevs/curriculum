# OR (||) operator

---

## Content

The `||` operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true. If both are false, it returns false.

```cpp
bool a = true;
bool b = false;

if(a || b) {
  printf("Either a or b is true.")
} else {
  printf("Both a and b are false.")
}
// Output: "Either a or b is true."
```

---

## Practice

What is the output of the following code?

```cpp
bool a = true;
bool b = false;

if(a || b) {
  printf("Either a, b or both a and b are true.")
} else {
  printf("Both a and b are false.")
}
// Output: ???
```
???

- "Either a, b or both a and b are true."
- "Both a and b is false."
