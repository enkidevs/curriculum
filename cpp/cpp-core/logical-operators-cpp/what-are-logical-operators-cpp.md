# Logical Operators

## Content

Logical operators in C++ are used to perform logical operations on the operands.

They mainly involve boolean values and they return a boolean value as a result. 

The logical operators provided by C++ include:

| Operator | Name |
|----------|------|
| `&&`     | AND  |
| `⎮⎮`     | OR   |
| `!`      | NOT  |
