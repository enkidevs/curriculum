# Assignment Operators in C++

---

## Content

In **C++**, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
```

**C++** also includes compound assignment operators such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=`. These operators modify the value of the variable:

```cpp
// equivalent to x = x + 5
x += 5;  
// equivalent to y = y * 2
y *= 2;
```
