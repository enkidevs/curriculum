# Creating and Storing Variables

---

## Content

You can also create variables using other variables:
```cpp
int x = 3
int a = x + 12;
std::cout << a;
// Outputs: 15
```


---
## Practice

Which of the following is **NOT** a way to create a variable in **C++**?

???

- x = 12;
- int x = 5;
- double y = 10.0;
- int y = 33;

---
## Revision

Finish the code to create a new integer variable called `z` by summing the values of the `x` and `y` variables. Print the new variable.
```cpp
int x = 3;
int y = 7;

??? ??? = x ??? y;

std::cout << z;
// 10
```

- `int`
- `z`
- `+`
- `-`
- `plus`
- `double`
