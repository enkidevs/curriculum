# Advanced Printing

---

## Content

In C++, we can also use the `printf()` function from the C Standard Library to print messages to the console. This  allows us to format strings in a way similar to placeholders:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
printf("Hello, world!");
// Hello, world!
```

To output a value from a variable:
```cpp
int age = 30;
printf("Stefan is %d years old.", age);

// Stefan is 30 years old.
```

## Practice

Print a message to the console and add a newline character after the message:
```cpp
???("Hello, world!???")
```

- `printf`
- `\n`
- `stdout`
- `\nextLine`
