# Vector Methods

---

## Content

Vectors come with several built-in methods!

For example, `size()` returns the number of elements in the vector:

```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers;

printf("Size: %d\n", numbers.size());
// Output: Size: 0

numbers.push_back(1);
printf("Size: %d\n", numbers.size());  
// Output: Size: 1
```
