# Vectors

---

## Content

Vectors[1] are dynamic arrays, which can grow and shrink in size.

They also come with built-in functions that allow you to manipulate the data easily.



Here's how you can define a vector:
```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> numbers;
```

In the example, `numbers` is a vector that can hold integers.

[1: STL]

The vector is a template class in the Standard Template Library (STL). We have to include it before using it.
