# Vectors

---

## Content

You can add elements to the vector using the `push_back()` function:
```cpp
numbers.push_back(1);
numbers.push_back(5);
```

To access an element in the vector, use the index of that element (indexing starts at 0):

```cpp
printf("%d\n", numbers[0]);  
// Output: 1

printf("%d\n", numbers[1]); 
// Output: 5
```

## Practice

Given the `nums` vector, use the built-in method to add the number 7 to it:
```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> nums;

???.???(7);
```
