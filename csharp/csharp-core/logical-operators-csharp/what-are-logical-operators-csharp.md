# Logical Operators

## Content

Logical operators in **C#** are used to perform logical operations on the operands.

They mainly involve boolean values and they return a boolean value as a result.

The logical operators provided by **C#** include:

| Operator | Name |
| :------: | :--: |
|    `&&`    | AND  |
|   `⎮⎮`   |  OR  |
|    `^`     | XOR  |
|    `!`     | NOT  |
