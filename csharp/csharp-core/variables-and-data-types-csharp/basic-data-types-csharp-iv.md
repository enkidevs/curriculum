## Content

The `bool` type is used to represent boolean values, which are either `true` or `false`.
```cpp
bool isTrue = true;
Console.WriteLine(isTrue);
// true
```

---
## Practice

Complete the following code snippet by declaring a `bool` variable named `isTrue` and assigning it a value of `true`.

```csharp
??? isTrue = ???;
```

- `bool`
- `true`
- `char`
- `false`
