### What is a KPI?

A **KPI** (Key Performance Indicator) is a type of key metric that measures an organization's progress towards a goal, target or objective. 

Imagine we want to sail from New York City to Southampton. Useful KPIs would be the GPS location data, average speed and fuel levels of the boat as well as information about the weather and wind direction. 

These KPIs help the team to understand whether they're on track for their destination or veering off route. KPIs will enable them to make *better informed decisions*. 🧭

### What makes a good KPI?

A good KPI depends on a company's goal.

If a company's goal is to *make more money*, it might want to focus on **sales growth**, **profit margins**, **operating costs** and **average revenue per user (ARPU)**.

If a company's goal is to *drive engagement*, it might want to focus on things like **daily active users/monthly active users (DAU/MAU)**, **pageviews** and **average session duration**.

If a company's goal is *customer satisfaction*, it might want to focus on **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**[1] or **customer retention rate**.

If a company wants to attract new customers by *creating a great brand*, it might focus on **brand equity** and **brand awareness**.

If a company wants to ensure *employee engagement*, it might want to focus on **staff advocacy** as a KPI.

> 💡 Most companies have multiple goals and so they'll want to keep track of multiple different KPIs. This makes selecting useful KPIs *even more important*.

Don't worry if you don't understand some of these terms because we're going to explore these metrics in greater depth over the next few role-specific workouts 🔍.

## Footnotes

[1:Net Promoter Score]
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric that can be used to gauge customer loyalty for a company's brand, products or services. It's often measured alongside other customer satisfaction research and is claimed to be correlated with revenue growth. 

NPS is calculated as the difference between the percentage of *promoters* and *detractors*. NPS is not expressed as a percentage but as an absolute number lying between -100 and +100.

`NPS = Promotors - Detractors`

For instance, if 25% of the surveyed audience are Promoters, while 55% Passives and 20% Detractors, the NPS will be +5.
