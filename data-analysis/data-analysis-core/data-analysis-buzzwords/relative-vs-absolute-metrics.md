# Relative vs Absolute measures


---

## Content

KPIs are either **absolute**, meaning that they measure the *total value* of something, or they're **relative**, meaning that they track something compared to something else. 

### Absolute KPI

If you divide an absolute metric by another absolute metric, you get a relative measurement.

An example of an **absolute KPI** is pageviews. Company X received 1 million pageviews in a given month. 

It's useful to track absolute metrics against different time periods so that you can spot trends.

### Relative KPI

Average session duration per user is an example of a **relative KPI**. 

It is calculated by dividing the total *duration* of all sessions (in seconds) by the total *number* of sessions during that same time frame.

> 💡 People often focus, and sometimes even overglorify, absolute metrics when really they should be tracking metrics on a relative basis. 

### Example

Let's look at an example to understand how important it is to choose the right metrics, and not get caught in the trap of **vanity metrics**[1].

Imagine that **total session duration** for an e-commerce site is very high one month. This may not be because more users are using the site. A smaller than average number of users could be spending much more time on the site. 

A more useful metric to track whether the site is attracting more users and whether those users are spending longer on the site could be the **average session duration per user**.

## Footnotes

[1: Vanity Metric]
Vanity metrics are metrics that make you look good to others but don't help you understand your own performance in a way that informs future strategies. 

They are hollow metrics that look nice on the surface but hold little substance. For example, 10,000 total registered accounts might seem impressive, but that number loses face quickly if there are only 100 active monthly users.
