# Basic Terminology I

## Content

Let's make sure you're comfortable with these core statistical concepts üîß.

### Correlation[1]

Measures how much one set of values **depends on another**. 

Variables can be positively or negatively correlated or have no correlation.

Think about height and shoe size. These are *positively correlated* variables. 

### Mean

The mean gives us a sense of a ‚Äútypical‚Äù or average value for a group of numbers.

It is calculated by dividing the **sum of a list of values** by the **number of values** in that list.

For example, using the following list of numbers:

```plain-text
[10, 10, 10, 12]
```

The mean would be ( 10 + 10 + 10 + 12 ) / 4 = 10.5

### Median

If we had a set of values listed in order, the median is whatever value is **in the middle**. We often use the median along with the mean to judge if there are any *outliers*.

Using the list above, the median is 10.

## Practice

As the temperature goes down, ice cream sales also go down. This is an example of ???.

- positive correlation
- no correlation
- negative correlation

## Revision

Imagine we have the following list of numbers:

[5, 5, 5, 15]

Mean = ???
Median = ???

- 7.5
- 5
- 10
- 15

## Footnotes

[1:Correlation]

If values increase or decrease together, they are **positively correlated**. If values from one set increase as the other decreases, they are **negatively correlated**. 

There is **no correlation** when a change in one set has nothing to do with a change in the other.
