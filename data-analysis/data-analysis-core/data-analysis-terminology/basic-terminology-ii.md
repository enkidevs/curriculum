# Basic Terminology II

## Content

### Outlier

A data point that is considered **extremely far** from other points. 

If you spot any outliers, make sure you investigate them to understand what caused them - either exceptional cases or maybe an error in measurement. 

### Variance[1]

Measures how **spread out** values in a data-set are.

The square root of the variance gives us the **standard deviation**, which is more intuitively useful because it’s expressed in the same units as the values themselves.

If we plotted out the points from a normally distributed[2] data set this would form a bell-shaped curve. 

The steeper the curve, the smaller the variance, ie. *the less spread out the data is*.

### Residual / Error

A measure of how much a real value differs from another measure (such as the mean). 

For example, given a prediction that it will be 20 degrees fahrenheit at noon tomorrow, when noon hits and it's only 18 degrees, we have an error (or residual) of 2 degrees.

## Practice

Complete this equation:

```plain-text
??? = √variance 
```

- standard deviation
- residual
- error
- outlier

## Revision

A bell-shaped curve depicts data that is normally distributed around a mean.

## Footnotes

[1:Variance]

Mathematically speaking, variance is defined as the sum of the squared distances of each term in the distribution from the mean (μ), divided by the number of terms in the distribution (N).

[2: Normal Distribution]
A normally distributed data set has these features:

- mean = median = mode
- symmetry about the centre
- 50% of values less than the mean
- and 50% greater than the mean

Here are some examples that closely follow a normal distribution:

- heights of people
- size of things produced by machines
- errors in measurements
- blood pressure
- marks on a test
