# More Terminology


---

## Content

And here is the last set of important terms to be aware of ðŸ¤“.

### Statistical Significance

A result is statistically significant when we judge that it probably **didnâ€™t happen due to chance**.

Check out the **Learn More** link for an explanation on how to calculate it!

### Regression[1]

Regression focuses on how a **target value changes** as other values within a data set change. 

Regression problems generally deal with continuous variables, like how square footage and location affect the price of a house.

### Database

A **storage space for data**.

We mostly use databases with a Database Management System (DBMS), like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**. 

These are computer applications that allow us to interact with a database to collect and analyze the information inside.

You can use SQL[2] to query databases to retrieve any information.

### Data Mining

Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns** in large data sets that involves machine learning, statistics, and database systems methods.

### Business Intelligence (BI)

Similar to data analysis, but more narrowly focused on **business metrics**. 

The technical side of BI involves learning how to effectively use software to generate reports and find important trends. Itâ€™s descriptive, rather than predictive.

We'll be looking at some of the most popular BI tools, such as Tableau, Looker and Mode, later on!

## Footnotes

[1:Regression]

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a **dependent variable** and **one or more independent variables**. 

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line  that most closely fits the data.

[2:SQL]

SQL, Structured Query Language, is the main language that allows your database servers to store, edit and retrieve the data on it.

SQL statements are used to generate queries to the database. This allows users to manipulate and pull data quickly.
