# Conditional Formatting


---

## Content

Once you're happy with your raw data, you may want to **duplicate this tab** or **open a new tab** so that you can explore what's going on.

> 💡 Remember, we recommend keeping your raw data tab untouched so that you always have the original source data if needed.

One way that we can highlight, emphasize, or differentiate data is by adding some **color**.

Imagine that we want to keep track of items that have been returned.

We have a column named "Returned", and each row has the value "Yes" or "No".

If our sheet is very large we don't want to repeatedly scroll to check this column the whole time, so we could use **conditional formatting** to highlight the whole row if it has the value "Yes" in the "Returned" column.

Just click on `Format > Conditional Formatting` and you'll see the choice of format rules and colors available to you. 

Now you can easily spot items that have been returned and you can get a clearer idea of the proportion of returned items vs non-returned.

Check out the **Learn More** link for some more use cases for when conditional formatting will save you a lot of time.
