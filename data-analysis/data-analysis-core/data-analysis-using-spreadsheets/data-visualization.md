# Data Visualization


---

## Content

Before you present or share your findings, you should make sure that your data is **displayed in the best way possible** so that others can easily understand what story you're telling.

Through machine learning, Google has already worked out the best way to visualize your data.

If you select the data you want to visualize and then click on either `Insert > Chart` or `Explore` in the bottom right-hand corner then the most appropriate graph or chart will be selected automatically.

These can always be changed if you prefer a different type of chart. 

There are loads to choose from including **line and area graphs**, **column, bar and pie charts**, **scatter plots**, and, if you have geographical data, even **maps**!

> 💡 To represent different data over time using lines and bars, try a **combo chart**. For example, you can show revenue in bars and profit margin in a line across the same chart, giving you a more complete picture of your organization’s financial health.

> 💡 To draw attention to a key metric or KPI, try the **scorecard chart**. For example, you can show the total sales number for your organization’s top selling product, and even call out percentage changes over time.

You can also edit loads of other display options such as the axes, legends and colors. 

You can click directly on data labels, chart titles, or legends to reposition them.

Once you're happy with your results they should be shared. G Suite lets you give **view or edit access** to anyone you choose, or you can even embed charts into other G Suite apps, like Google Docs or Slides.
