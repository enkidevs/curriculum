# Intro to Spreadsheets


---

## Content

Spreadsheets allow **anyone** to quickly analyze pretty *large amounts of data*.

When we think about our Data Analysis process, we can do all the key steps such as cleaning, exploring and visualizing data using spreadsheets 🎉.

We're going to be using **Google Sheets** throughout this workout as it's a free tool - you just need access to a Google account to be able to use it.

> 💡 Google Sheets has nearly all the same functionality as Excel. Check out the **Learn More** link to read about the minor differences.

Along with the basic functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE` and `COUNT`, you'll want to be familar with these other useful functions:

`SUMIF` / `AVERAGEIF`
Calculates the sum or average based on a chosen criteria.

`COUNTIF`
Counts the number of instances based on a chosen criteria.

`MAX` / `MIN`
Finds the maximum or minimum number in a range.

`VLOOKUP` / `HLOOKUP`
Pulls data from matching cells (ones that match from either a vertical or horizontal range).

`FIND` / `SEARCH`
Returns 1 if a search criterion has been met, 0 if not.

`SUMPRODUCT`
Multiples one range of values by its corresponding row counterparts.

Check out the *Data Analysis Functions* **Learn More** link for some examples of how to use each of these if you're unsure.

We also have our own Spreadsheets course which covers everything in much more depth 🔎.
