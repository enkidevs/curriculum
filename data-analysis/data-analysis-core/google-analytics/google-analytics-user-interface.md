**Realtime** 

This section lets you look at **live user behavior** on your website including information like where your users are coming from and if they're converting.

**Audience**

Audience reports show you **characteristics about your users** like age, gender, location, interests, how engaged they are, whether they're new or returning, what technology they're using and many more.

**Acquisition**

Acquisition reports show you **which channels brought users to your site**. This could include marketing channels such as Organic (unpaid search), CPC[1] (paid search), Referral (traffic that comes from another website) or Social (from a social network).

**Behavior**

Behavior reports show you **how people engaged on your site** including which pages they viewed, and their landing and exit pages. You can even check what they searched for whilst on the site.

**Conversions**

Conversion reports allow you to **track website goals** based on your business objectives.
