# Why Google Analytics?


---

## Content

Do you have a blog? A static website? Do you run an e-commerce platform or webapp? If the answer is yes, whether they are for personal or business use, then you should consider using **Google Analytics**. 

Here are just a few of the many questions that Google Analytics can answer about your site:

- How many people visit my website?
- Where do my visitors live?
- Do I need a mobile-friendly website?
- Which other websites send traffic to my website?
- What marketing tactics drive the most traffic to my website?
- Which pages on my website are the most popular?
- How many visitors have I converted into leads or customers?
- Where did my converting visitors come from and go on my website?
- How can I improve my website's speed?
- What blog content do my visitors like the most?

Google Analytics is the **most popular web analytics tool in the world**.

It's used by around 64% of the Top 500 US Retailers, 45% of Fortune 500 companies, and 56% of the top 1 million domains. All of these metrics combine to give Google Analytics a market share of over 82%!

What's more, Google Analytics is **free** 🎉.

If you want more advanced features, then there is a recurring fee. The premium platform is called Google Analytics 360[1].
