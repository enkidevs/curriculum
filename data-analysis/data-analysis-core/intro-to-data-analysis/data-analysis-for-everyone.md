# Data Analysis For Everyone


---

## Content

We believe that pretty much everyone **should** get better at analyzing data.

1. 🙋‍♂️ It's a valuable skill for **you**

At its heart, data analysis is about problem solving. The ability to think analytically and approach problems in the right way is a skill that's **always useful**, not just in the professional world, but in everyday life too.

Data analysis skills are more likely to put you in high demand when it comes to landing a new role/job. Higher demand -> higher salaries 💰.

2. 👩‍💻 It's valuable for your **company**

Learning about data analysis will help you understand technical teammates, be more independent with your data needs, ask better questions, communicate insights better, and be an "analytics translator" for your company. 

The more people that can talk data, the more efficient a company becomes.

3. 🌍 It's valuable for the **world**

Imagine a world where we make well informed decisions on a macro scale. Urban planning, protecting the environment, public health and poverty reduction can all be impacted by data if we learn how to use it effectively.
