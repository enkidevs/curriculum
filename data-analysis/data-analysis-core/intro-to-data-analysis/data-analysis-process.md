# Data Analysis Process


---

## Content

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty let's take a look at the whole data analysis process.

There are 5 key steps:

1. **Question** 🤔

What do you want to find out? Data analysis must start with a problem you want to solve.

2. **Wrangle** 🧹

Data wrangling is the process of acquiring and cleaning your data.

3. **Explore*** 🔍

This is where you use tools to get famililar and spot patterns in your data.

4. **Conclude** 💡

What are your findings? Can you make any predictions?

5. **Communicate** 📈

What format would work best for sharing your conclusions? A blogpost, email or presentation to inform your colleagues? It's important to know how to use some data visualization tools to bring your findings to life.

> 💡 These 5 steps don't always happen in a straight line.

Data wrangling and exploration are heavily intertwined. You'll need to revisit and refine your questions throughout as you become more famililar with your data. Sometimes data acquisition comes first!
