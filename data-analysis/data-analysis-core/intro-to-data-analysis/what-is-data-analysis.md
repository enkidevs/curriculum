## Content

Data analysis is the method of **discovering useful information** from data. 

The process involves collecting, organizing, exploring and drawing conclusions from data.

> ðŸ’¡ Broadly speaking, you can think of data analysis as **translating numbers** into **meaningful words**. 

Data analysis is **all around us** - just think about how Netflix chooses which movies to display, and what appears on your Instagram newsfeed. 

Walmart uses data analysis to figure out what to stock. They've even statistically proven that strawberry Pop-Tarts sell seven times better before a big storm. ðŸ¤¯
