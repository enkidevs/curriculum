# Market Analysis

## Content

**Market analysis** is different to marketing analytics. 

Market analysis studies the **attractiveness** and **dynamics** of a market within an industry.

You may want to consider things like *your* offering vs competitors, size of the industry, rate of growth, trends and sustainability. 

Once you've got a broad picture you may want to zoom in on a **target market**. Who do you want to sell to? What's their income range? Where do they live? Do they live fast-paced lives? Do they prefer coffee ☕️ or beer 🍺? 

Finding out as many specific details as possible about your target market is vital for placing your product correctly.

We can use analysis techniques like **Competitor Analysis** (more subjective) or working out the **Total Addressable Market** (more objective) to solidify our findings.

Competitor Analysis can be as simple as using other products and scoring different attributes of each product out of 10. The key is to work out what *your competitive advantage is*. Here are some tips for carrying out [effective competitor analysis](https://realbusiness.co.uk/6-top-tips-for-carrying-out-a-thorough-competitor-analysis/).

Total Addressable Market (TAM) can be used to calculate the potential revenue opportunity of a product or service, which is useful for companies when they're prioritizing opportunities.
