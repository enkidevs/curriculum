# Marketing Metrics


---

## Content

Marketing analytics is a broad area, so we've compiled a list of some of the *most useful metrics* to track:

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
  This metric helps you to understand the costs associated with growing your business and expanding your customer base. This is especially useful for startups attempting to scale quickly or demonstrate their value to investors.

CAC for a given time period can be calculated using this simple formula:

```plain-text
(Money + Time Spent) / Number of customers acquired
```

- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), or Lifetime Value of a Customer (LTV)**
  This metric tracks the total amount of value a buyer provides over their lifetime â€“ from their first purchase through to their moment of churn.

CLV can be calculated by:

```plain-text
(Annual revenue per customer * Number of active years) - (Customer Acquisition Cost)
```
