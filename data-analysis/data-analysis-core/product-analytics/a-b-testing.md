# A/B Testing


---

## Content

Without experimentation, companies can’t innovate; they can only guess.

**A/B testing** is a process of experimentation where you show **two variants** of a web page or email to different groups and compare which variant is more effective.

Marketing teams may want to perform an A/B test to drive conversion. Similarly, product teams can use A/B tests to drive engagement.

Social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram use A/B testing all the time to make user experiences more successful.

Here's our 6-step guide to conduct an A/B test:

1. **Pick one variable to test**
   To evaluate how effective a change is, you'll want to isolate one "independent variable" and measure its performance — otherwise, you can't be sure which one was responsible for changes in performance[1].

2. **Create a 'control' and a 'challenger'**
   Set up the unaltered version of whatever you're testing as your "control" then build a variation, or a "challenger" — the website, landing page, or email you’ll test against your control.

3. **Split your sample groups equally and randomly**
   Determine your sample size and then use a tool that will automatically split traffic to your variations so that each variation gets a random sampling of visitors.

4. **Decide how significant your results need to be**
   Statistical significance is a very important part of A/B testing process. Read [this thread](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-proper-statistical-tests-to-use-for-A-B-testing) to help you determine which statistical test to use to determine your desired level of statistical significance.

5. **Test both variations simultaneously**
   When you run A/B tests, you'll need to run the two variations at the same time, otherwise you may be left second-guessing whether it was a different time of day, week or month that affected your results.

6. **Give the A/B test enough time to produce useful data**
   You'll want to make sure that you let your test run long enough in order to obtain a substantial sample size[2].

After you've carried out your A/B test, you'll want to measure the significance of your results. You can do this by using an A/B testing calculator.

We recommend using one of the leading tools like Google Analytics, Optimizely, Mixpanel or Hubspot's complete A/B Testing kit.

## Footnotes

[1: Multivariate Testing]
Multivariate testing uses the same core principles as A/B testing, but compares more than two variables, and reveals more information about how these variables interact with one another. 

As in an A/B test, traffic to a page is split between different versions of the design. The purpose of a multivariate test is to measure the effectiveness each design combination has on the ultimate goal.

[2: Sample Size]
Choosing the correct sample size is important for valid A/B tests. If we're running an A/B test to check whether conversion rates increase after a certain change then we need to know:

1. Current conversation rates (control group)
2. Desired conversion rates (challenger group)
3. Desired level of statistical significance
   We can use a [sample size calculator](https://www.optimizely.com/uk/sample-size-calculator/) to work out how many recipients or users we need to include in our test.
