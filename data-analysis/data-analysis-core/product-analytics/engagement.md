# Tracking Engagement


---

## Content

User engagement is when your customer is realizing value from your product, service, website or app.

User engagement leads to retention, which improves profitability. This is why it's very important to keep track of engagement. 

Teams must first decide what engagement means to them. Engagement can be measured by activity - downloads, clicks, shares etc.

Commonly used metrics to track engagement are **DAU**, **WAU** and **MAU**.

These stand for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Active Users. This is the **unique** amount of users who are **"active"** within a given amount of time.

How do we measure an "active" user?

Is "signed up" enough to define a user as "active"?

Perhaps it's better to measure a more valuable action like "Updated a Task", "Invited Collaborator", "Shared Content".

We can go even further by not looking at the absolute numbers, but by comparing the DAU with MAU to calculate **"stickiness"**.

A DAU/MAU ratio of 50% means that your users return 15 out of 30 days a month.
