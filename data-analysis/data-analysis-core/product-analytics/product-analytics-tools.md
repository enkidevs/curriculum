# Product Analytics Tools

## Content

There are so many great tools out there. Here are a few of our favorites!

### Mixpanel
Mixpanel can collect a lot of data for your CRO[1] experiments. Mixpanel helps you find the 'hidden gems buried in your data automatically' like the underperforming user segments, anomalies in your data trends, and more.

### Amplitude
Amplitude is very similar to Mixpanel as an essential Product Analytics tool. One key difference is that it automatically clusters similar users into behavioral cohorts — via their Personas.

### KissMetrics
KissMetrics helps you understand the customer behavior of your clients across **different devices** and identify what's working and what's not.

### Optimizely
This is one of the oldest and most powerful CRO tools on the market. It allows marketing departments and software development teams to apply a “culture of optimization” to their offerings.

### HotJar
HotJar helps you visualize the visitor behavior on your website with click, move, and scroll heatmaps.

### Google Analytics
Google Analytics is the #1 source for collecting website analytics data. You can use the free version, or if you want the more advanced features, a premium version — Google Analytics 360 — unlocks deeper insights.

We're dedicating a whole workout to Google Analytics, where we'll explore key features next!
