# Tracking Retention


---

## Content

To calculate the **retention rate**, you need to look at two numbers: the number of users at the beginning of the time frame, and the number of those users who are still users of the product at the end of that time frame.

```plain-text
Retention rate = ( (number of customers at the end - number of newly acquied customers) / number of customers at the start ) * 100
```

We can then plot a **retention curve**.

The retention curve has two key features:

- it tends to drop off really fast at the start
- the curve then (hopefully) tends to flatten out over time. 

If instead of flattening it hits hit zero, it's a strong signal you urgently need to improve user engagement.

The aim over time is to move the curve upwards by working to improve user engagement, both at the start when new users signup, as well as over time.

## Practice

Using the following formula:

```plain-text
Retention rate = ( (number of customers at the end - number of newly acquied customers) / number of customers at the start ) * 100
```

If we start with 500 customers and we acquire 100 new customers in a week, and we end the week with 500 customers, then our retention rate is:

???

- 80%
- 20%
- 100%
- 90%

## Revision

Using the following formula:

```plain-text
Retention rate = ( (number of customers at the end - number of newly acquied customers) / number of customers at the start ) * 100
```

If we start with 1000 customers and we acquire 100 new customers in a week, and we end the week with 1050 customers, then our retention rate is:

???

- 95%
- 100%
- 90% 
- 5%
