# Boost your performance

## Content

This workout is essential for anyone in sales - but we've also included content that would be **useful for everyone** to go over.

Sales teams should probably be the most data-driven team within a company.

**Every sales activity is measurable**. The main challenge is knowing *what* to track to improve performance.

A well-defined set of sales KPIs provides your team with **focus** and **clarity** so they can concentrate on doing what they do best.

Here are some useful metrics to track (per day/week/month):

- Number of calls made, emails sent, meetings scheduled, demos 
- Total sales 
- New leads 
- Lead conversion (total converted leads / all leads) 
- Sales per region or team member

There are loads of different options for what to track, so check out the **Learn More** link for more inspiration!

Sales metrics can narrate a story if displayed intuitively and clearly. Usually this is done through **reports** and **dashboards**. There are many tools out there for this - we'll share our favorites soon.

We recommend comparing these metrics against different time periods and adding in **targets** so that you can instantly spot problem areas.
