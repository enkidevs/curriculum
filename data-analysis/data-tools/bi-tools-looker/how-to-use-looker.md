# How to use Looker


---

## Content

In Looker there are two main types of content:

1. **Looks**
   Individual charts, graphs or tables.

2. **Dashboards**
   A collection of Looks displayed in tiles.

You can favorite any Looks or Dashboards by clicking on the heart next to the title.

If you *hover* over any visualization you can gain more insight.

If you *click* on any part of a visualization you can look at the underlying data in a table format.

The time tag in the top right corner of any Looks or Dashboards will tell you how recently Looker pulled the data. You can manually refresh it by clicking on the gear and then selecting *Clear Cache & Refresh*.

If the dashboard creator has added adjustable filters, then changing any filters only applies to your views. You don't need to worry about editing other people's views.

> 💡 For dashboard filters to work, tiles must be set up to listen to filters.

Other temporary changes include **sorting data** and **toggling which data is shown**. This can be done by clicking on that metric's label to hide that data.
