# Intro to Mode


---

## Content

Mode is an **SQL-based analytics tool *designed for analysts***.

Mode brings SQL and R/Python users together to work side-by-side. Not many other tools do this effectively. 

That means that it’s great if your analysts are always going to be the ones developing reports and answering questions. 

However, if you want business users to be able to explore from scratch, you’re likely to struggle. 

Users can still drag-and-drop their data to build dashboards, but only after they've queried the data using SQL.

Mode also aims to *drive collaboration around data projects*.

The shared workspaces and dashboards that the team can collaborate on are first class.

Some of the key features offered by Mode are:

- Write, save, and share SQL queries with other analysts in your company. 
- Empower non-technical folks to update queries on their own. 
- Run queries on a schedule, create lists of related reports, and explore a project's history as it changes over time.
- Build reports using standard charting or create completely customer, interactive visuals with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Database connectors for MySQL, Postgres, Redshift, Vertica, Hive, Heroku, Segment, BigQuery, Impala.
