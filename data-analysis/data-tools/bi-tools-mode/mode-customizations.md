# Mode Customizations

## Content

In terms of data visualization, Mode has a wide variety of built-in chart types to choose from.

One of the coolest things about Mode is that you can use their **HTML editor** to make fully-customizable charts and dashboards.

Once you've run your SQL queries, click into the Report Builder and select "Edit HTML" to open the HTML editor.

Here you can modify the code behind the individual elements in your report or build something completely custom using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, D3, etc. 

Mode allows you to build charts like these:

Design the report layout however you like: pick the charts and tables you want to show, rearrange their order, and specify the size of each element.

Check out the Mode gallery to see examples — the world is your oyster!
