# Dashboards and Stories

## Content

Dashboards allow you to to display **multiple worksheets** at once and are a great way to **add interactivity**. 

This can be done by adding **filters** to selected worksheets or all worksheets within a dashboard.

Dashboards are great for highlighting key findings, but say you're asked to present your findings you may want to go one step further and create a **story**.

The key benefit of creating a story on Tableau over a powerpoint is that you can walk viewers through your data discovery process. 

You also have the option to interactively explore your data to answer any questions that come up during your presentation.

A story is a workspace filled with sequential story points that have titles and captions to help you narrate your findings. 

Dashboards and stories can both be shared with your team using either Tableau Server, Tableau Online or Tableau Public (free option).
