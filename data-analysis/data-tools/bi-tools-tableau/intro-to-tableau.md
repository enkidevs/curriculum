# Intro to Tableau


---

## Content

Google Analytics is great for analyzing web traffic and user behavior but what if we want to explore the data inside our databases...

We'd need to use a BI[1] or business intelligence tool for that. 

**Tableau** is probably the most well-known of these BI tools. It aims to do more than make charts - but rather, to show *live visual analytics*. 

Tableau offers five main products: 

- **Tableau Desktop**, referred to as “the gold standard” in visual analytics, this is Tableau's main product for unlimited data exploration on interactive dashboards. This is a desktop tool (rather than browser based) and requires you to install software.

- **Tableau Server** allows you to share your data and dashboards with your team or company.

- **Tableau Online** is a browser based analytics platform fully hosted in the cloud. It has limited functionality compared to Tableau Desktop, but it allows you to share and collaborate without having to manage a server. Read this [useful comparison](https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-10262) between Tableau Server and Tableau Online.

- **Tableau Public** allows you to share dashboards for free, but it will be shared with the world.

- **Tableau Prep** changes the way traditional data wrangling is done by providing a visual and direct way to combine, shape and clean data. 

We'll be guiding you through the Desktop product for the rest of this workout. 🖥

## Footnotes

[1:BI tool]
BI stands for Business Intelligence. BI tools allow companies to perform data analysis. You can connect a BI tool with data from a SQL database, a spreadsheet, or cloud apps like Google Analytics and Salesforce.
