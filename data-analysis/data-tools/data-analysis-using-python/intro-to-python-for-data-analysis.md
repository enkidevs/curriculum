## Content

Python has become one of the **most popular** programming languages. It is also extremely **versatile**.

By using frameworks[1] like Django, Python can be used for building quick and scalable websites and webapps.

It's also widely used by the data science community, and has become especially popular for **analysis**, **visualization** and **data manipulation tasks**.

Why use Python over Excel?

1. Python is great for handling **large datasets** (no limit on the number of rows)
2. You can **combine multiple files**
3. You can use **data from many different places** - APIs, databases, CSVs and more
