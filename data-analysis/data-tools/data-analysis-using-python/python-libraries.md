# Python Libraries


---

## Content

When using Python for data analysis we can write our code in **Jupyter Notebooks**[1] which are supported by many ever-expanding **libraries**[2]. 

This is why Python is the preferred language when working with data.

Some of the most widely used libraries are:

- **NumPy**

Short for Numerical Python, NumPy is the foundational package for scientific computing. NumPy supports more complex mathematical operations such as matrix manipulations.

- **Pandas**

Pandas is dependent on NumPy and also adds in spreadsheet features by giving you a tabular data structure to view rows and columns. 

- **Matplotlib**

This is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other 2D data visualizations. The plots are also interactive so you can zoom in on a section of the plot to explore in more depth. 

- **Seaborn**

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

> 💡 Check out the **Learn More** link for how to install these libraries. They're a must-have when using Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis.

We're going to be exploring how to analyze data using these libraries next!

## Footnotes

[1: Jupyter Notebooks]
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

Use-cases include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

[2: Libraries]
A library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use.

Libraries are particularly useful for storing frequently used routines because you do not need to explicitly link them to every program that uses them.
