# What is SQL?


---

## Content

If you have access to your company's database, or to a cloned/follower database, then it's worth learning some basic SQL. 

Knowing SQL empowers you to *answer your own questions* without needing to ask in-house analysts. You'll have greater **independence**.

Performing SQL queries is much **faster** than importing data into a spreadsheet and then exploring it that way.

Also, even if you only know some basic SQL then you already have a **solid toolkit** for data analysis.

Think of SQL as pivot tables on steroids. 💪

It enables you to extract, aggregate and filter your data directly from the database.

As databases amass more data, your SQL results will change to reflect any real-time changes.

This workout is going to give you all the high-level facts to get you going. We recommend checking out our separate **SQL skill** to explore SQL in much more depth!
