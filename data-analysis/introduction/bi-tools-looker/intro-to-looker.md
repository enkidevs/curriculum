# Intro to Looker

---
## Content

**Looker** is another **popular BI tool** that allows you to drag and drop fields to create individual reports or dashboards. 

Fields are grouped by Dimensions (gray) and Measures (orange).

There are many similarities between Looker and Tableau. They are both **powerful** and **easy-to-use** platforms. They're both excellent for data-visualization.

However, unlike Tableau Desktop, Looker is 100% browser-based. So there's no need to install any software. Looker dashboards also work on any device.

In terms of customer types, Looker is probably used by more start-ups than Tableau, but the differences in customers are narrowing as the prices are becoming more similar.
