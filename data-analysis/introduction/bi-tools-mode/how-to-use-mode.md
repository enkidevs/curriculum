# How to use Mode

---
## Content

Mode can be implemented and analysis can be run using these 6 simple steps:

1. 💼 **Create an organization**

Organizations are groups of Mode users that can securely share database connections and analysis with each other.

2. 🔌 **Connect a database**

Mode can connect to most popular databases SQL databases. Once you connect your database, everyone in your organization can execute queries against it by default.

3. 🕺 **Invite collaborators**

To invite someone to join your organization, start from the Mode home page for your organization, click on your name in the upper left corner, and then click Invite to Mode.

4. 👩‍💻 **Query data** 

You’ll need to write and execute SQL queries against one or more connected databases. In Mode, this is done within a report.

To create a new report, click the new report  button in the upper right hand corner of the Mode home page. You will be taken to the Query Editor where you can compose SQL code.

5. 📊 **Visualize results** 

Once you’ve written a query or two and have some data to play with, click Report Builder in the left panel to begin curating components — tables, charts, or Notebook output cells—in a shareable report. 

Design the report layout however you like: pick the charts and tables you want to show, rearrange their order, and specify the size of each element.

6. 📮 **Share your work** 

Share your analysis with others. Mode makes it easy to share your work with other members of your organization, whether via email, Slack, or sending a URL.
