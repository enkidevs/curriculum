# Using Jupyter Notebooks

---
## Content

If there is one tool which every data scientist should use or must be comfortable with, it is a **Jupyter Notebook**.

Jupyter Notebooks are powerful, versatile, shareable and provide the ability to perform data visualization in the same environment.

They're also super user-friendly as you can write lines of code and run them *one at a time*.

> ðŸ’¡ Check out the **Learn More** link for how to install a Jupyter Notebook. It's a very quick and simple set up.

Once installed, you can launch a notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` into the terminal. This will automatically open a local environment where you can explore your dataset on `http://localhost:8888/tree`.

In the first cell you should import any libraries that you want to use.

> ðŸ’¡ Jupyter allows you to write in several different formats. Make sure that you select Code for any Python code.

You can then click `Run` to execute this code.

> ðŸ’¡ We use aliases ("as np", "as pd", "as plt") so that we can reference these libraries more quickly when we use them.

You can also write in markdown[1]. This is particularly useful to add any explanations or narrative text in adjacent cells.

Next we're going to look out how to use these libraries so that we can explore our data!

## Footnotes

[1:Markdown]
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
