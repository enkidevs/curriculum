# Pivot Tables

---
## Content

As a spreadsheet grows and has more and more records, you'll need tools to understand the data inside it.

**Pivot Tables** are such a tool. They enable us to quickly gain insights from large data sets. That's why they're a **pretty big deal**.

To create a pivot table in Google Sheets, go to `Data > Pivot Table`.

Once you've inserted your Pivot Table on a new tab or on the existing sheet, you can select which data you want to populate the rows and columns with from the right side of your screen.

The values inside the table will be based on different aggregations of your raw data, such as COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE etc. 

Let's think about a spreadsheet filled with lots of purchase information - each row represents an order, and we have columns for product, desciption, category, price and whether or not it has been returned. 

A Pivot Table could be used to quickly assess the *number of returned items per product*, or the *average price of items within a particular category*.

On the right side of your screen, you'll also see options for how you want to **sort** and **filter** your data.

By using Pivot Tables we can quickly calculate the average price of items per category and apply a filter that only shows unreturned items.

We'll cover how to convert pivot tables into graphical data visualizations next!
