# What is SQL?

---
## Content

If you have access to your company's database, or to a cloned/follower database, then it's worth learning some basic SQL. 

Knowing SQL empowers you to *answer your own questions* without needing to ask in-house analysts. You'll have greater **independence**.

Performing SQL queries is much **faster** than importing data into a spreadsheet and then exploring it that way.

Also, even if you only know some basic SQL then you already have a **solid toolkit** for data analysis.

Think of SQL as pivot tables on steroids. ðŸ’ª

It enables you to extract, aggregate and filter your data directly from the database.

As databases amass more data, your SQL results will change to reflect any real-time changes.

This workout is going to give you all the high-level facts to get you going. We recommend checking out our separate **SQL skill** to explore SQL in much more depth!
