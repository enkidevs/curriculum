# SQL Tools

## Content

Once you have selected, joined and filtered your data to grab everything you need, then you're ready for the next step - **visualizing and sharing** it.

Most SQL editors allow you to export the results in a *CSV format*, or you could connect to a SQL-based data-visualization tool to format your results so that they're *ready for sharing*.

Some great SQL editors are **Postico** or **DBeaver**, and they're both free! 

Using these editors you can connect to your database, write SQL queries and visualize the results in a table.

Another great free tool is **Google Data Studio**. 

Here you can connect to your database, write your queries and visualize the results using charts, scorecards, nicely formatted tables and more.

This allows you to carry out all analysis **in one place**.

Other Data Visualization tools include **Tableau**, **Looker** and **Mode**. We'll cover how to use each of these in greater depth later on. 

These tools are pretty expensive but are extremely user friendly as you can drag and drop database fields to visualize the data.

**Periscope** and **Chartio** are cheaper alternatives and have most of the same functionality as these pro tools.

Comment below if you have any favorite SQL tools that we haven't mentioned! ðŸ‘‡
