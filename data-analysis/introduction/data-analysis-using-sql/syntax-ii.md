# SQL Syntax II

So we can select different columns and aggregate any numerical fields, but what if we only want to select data where a certain condition is true?

That's where we can use our `WHERE` keyword.

Take the following example:

```
SELECT year, title
FROM movies
WHERE title = "Pulp Fiction"
```

It returns a table with two columns - the `year` and `title` of any movies that match the exact name "Pulp Fiction".

| year | title                         |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1994 | Pulp Fiction                  |


Currently our `WHERE` filter is pretty strict as the results must match whatever is inside the `" "`. 

Let's look at a less strict example:

```
SELECT year, title
FROM movies
WHERE year < 2005
AND title = "%Harry Potter%"
```

| year | title                                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 2001 | Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone |
| 2002 | Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  |
| 2004 | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban |

We can add in multiple `WHERE` clauses using the `AND` keyword. Wrapping "Harry Potter" in `%`, the wildcard character, allows you to pick up all titles that have "Harry Potter" somewhere in the name..

Check out the **Learn More** link to find out how to make `WHERE` less strict by using the keywords `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `AND`, `OR` and `IN`, as well as wildcards `%`.

As you can see, the results are returned in the same order that they're stored in the database.

If we wanted to sort them by year in descending order then we can use the `ORDER` keyword:

```
SELECT year, title
FROM movies
WHERE year < 2005
AND title = "%Harry Potter%"
ORDER BY year DESC
```

This will reverse the order of the results.

If you don't include the keywords `DESC` or `ASC` then `ORDER BY` will automatically sort the data by `ASC`, ascending order.

## Practice

Complete the following query to return all students that are born before the year 2000 and have a first name beginning with the letter 'A':

```
SELECT name
FROM students
??? year_of_birth ??? 2000
??? first_name ??? 'A%'
```

- WHERE
- <
- AND
- =
- >
- OR
