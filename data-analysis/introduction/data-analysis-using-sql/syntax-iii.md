# Joins

## Content

A slightly more complex concept in SQL are **joins**.

Joins allow us to grab results from *multiple tables at once*.

Previously we had just used our `movies` table. 

Imagine we also have access to a `directors` table that includes information about a director's name, date of birth, nationality and education.
 
What if we want to get results from both our `movies` and `directors` tables at once?

As **every movie belongs to a director**, we have a reference[1] to this director into our movies table. 

This is done using IDs. IDs are automatically assigned to every database entry (row) and every entry has a unique ID.

Our `movies` table includes a `director_id` column which points to the id of each director in the `directors` table. Every movie (row) contains a `director_id` value.

The `JOIN` clause matches the IDs from the `director_id` column on the `movies` table to the `id` column on the `directors` table.

Imagine we wanted to find out the years and titles of all movies directed by `Quentin Tarantino`:

```
SELECT year, title
FROM movies
JOIN directors ON movies.director_id = directors.id
WHERE directors.name = "Quentin Tarantino"
```

We can join the table `directors` to `movies` by matching the `director_id` from the `movies` table, `movies.director_id`, on the `id` from the `directors` table, `directors.id`.

| year | title                         |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1992 | Reservoir Dogs                |
| 1994 | Pulp Fiction                  |
| 1997 | Jackie Brown                  |
| 2003 | Kill Bill: Volume 1           |
| 2004 | Kill Bill: Volume 2           |
| 2007 | Grindhouse: Death Proof       |
| 2009 | Inglourious Basterds          |
| 2012 | Django Unchained              |
| 2015 | The Hateful Eight             |
| 2019 | Once Upon a Time in Hollywood |

In order to be specific about which table you're selecting data from, you can write the table name before each column. 

We can rewrite the above query to be more specific:

```
SELECT movies.year, movies.title
FROM movies
JOIN directors ON movies.director_id = directors.id
WHERE directors.name = "Quentin Tarantino"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note, the order you write each clause matters. `WHERE` clauses must come after `SELECT`, `FROM` and `JOIN`.

We've explored one type of `JOIN`, the `(INNER) JOIN`, so check out the **Learn More** link to discover the other three join types.

## Practice

Imagine that each student belongs to one university.

Complete the following query to join the students table to the universities table:

```
SELECT students.name, universities.name
FROM students
??? universities ??? students.university_id ??? universities.id
```
- JOIN
- ON
- =
- WHERE
- IN

## Revision

Imagine that each superpower belongs to one superhero.

Complete the following query to join the superpowers table to the superheroes table:

```
SELECT superpowers.name, superheroes.name
FROM superpowers
??? superheroes ??? superpowers.superhero_id ??? superheroes.id
```
- JOIN
- ON
- =
- WHERE
- IN
