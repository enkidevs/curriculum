### Dashboards and Goals

Google Analytics displays data using **metrics** and **dimensions**. Metrics are *quantitative measurements* and dimensions are ways to view and segment *qualitative data*.

For example, the bounce rate[1] is a *metric* that could be tracked across different webpages - those webpages are the *dimensions*.

We can use metrics and dimensions to build customized dashboards in `Customization > Dashboards > Create`

> 💡 You can have 20 shared dashboards per user, and 50 shared dashboards per view. Your original dashboard can't be changed by another user.

If you have admin access to a Google Analaytics account then you can set **Goals**. 🏆

Goals can be based on a **user's destination** (exit url), **duration**, **pages per session** or **event** (purchase or signup).

### Integrations

Google Analytics can also link data from other Google marketing tools like **Google Ads**, **AdSense**, or the **Google Search Console**.

Linking tools together allows us to *optimize our ad campaigns* as we can easily track the clicks, impressions, cost, bounce rate and many more metrics for each group of keywords. 

Again you can always segment your data by dimensions such as device (mobile vs desktop).

> 💡 In order to integrate tools, you must be logged into Google Analytics with the same email address as whichever tool you wish to link.

### User Type

It's also worth noting another useful dimension - **user type**. This segments users into *new* or *returning* visitors. 

New users are *first-time users*. Google’s tracking snippet creates a random, unique ID that gets associated with the user's browser cookie. Each unique ID is a unique user.

> 💡 This information will be lost if a user clears their browsing data, and Google Analytics also doesn't recognise users who visit sites from different devices by default.

## Footnotes

[1:Bounce Rate]
The bounce rate is the percentage of users who left your website after viewing a single page and taking no additional actions.

Companies aim to have as low a bounce rate as possible.
