# Data Analysis vs Data Science

---

## Content

Data Analytics and Data Science are both a mishmash of terms which interweave and overlap with one another but are still quite different.

**Data Analysis** involves answering questions based on the *past* or *present* for *better business decision making*. 

Meanwhile, **Data Science** focuses on discovering new questions to *drive innovation* through machine learning[1] and predictive modelling.

Data Analytics is more specific and concentrated than Data Science. It aims to solve a specific problem.

> ðŸ’¡ You don't need to be a Data Analyst or Data Scientist to get going with analysis work.

Phew! So what skills do you need to be able to gain insights from data?

We recommend some dexterity or familiarity in the following areas:

- Knowledge of basic statistics 
- Problem solving skills
- Basic/intermediate level Excel/Google Sheets

And for those looking to become real data ninjas: 

- Understanding of SQL databases and basic queries
- Experience using business intelligence tools
- Ability to visualize your results

We're going to jump into some of these skills throughout this course. ðŸ’ª
