**SEO[1] Analytics** covers the methods that **measure and track** how an organisation can improve their website's ranking on search engines like Google.

> ðŸ’¡ Google changes its algorithms constantly. The SEO strategies and measurements we use today might very well have to be tweaked and adjusted tomorrow.

Here are some top tools for conducting SEO Analysis:

- **Google Search Console**

This service helps you monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot your site's presence in Google Search results. Google Search Console is pretty much the most useful free tool out there, read about it [here](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).

- Hubspot's **Website Grader**

This tool allows you to enter a URL and receive personalized reports based on the following key metrics: performance, mobile readiness, SEO and security.

They even provide you with a [free lesson](https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/enhancing-seo-for-a-website) on how to improve your SEO!

- **Google Analytics**. 

This is the king of marketing analysis tools, having been around since 2005. 

It was built for marketers to understand the first part of the user journey (where users are coming from). Read about Google Analytic's SEO features [here](https://databox.com/google-analytics-for-seo).

We'll be digging into Google Analytics in more depth in a later workout.
