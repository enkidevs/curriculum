# Intro to Product Analytics

---
## Content

**Product Analytics** allows companies to fully understand how users **engage** with what they build.

Successful product analysis would track KPIs like like engagement, retention, and conversion.

It answers questions like:

- Who are your power users? And how do their behaviors differ from other users? 
- Why do some users convert, while others donâ€™t?
- How does retention differ by user cohort? Is it higher or lower when people engage with a particular feature?
- What are the top drivers of user engagement and retention?
- Did that new feature release cause the desired change in behavior?

> ðŸ’¡ Don't get caught up in the trap of extending your marketing analytics tools tools to cover product analysis. 

Product analytics is a separate area and deserves its own tools. We'll cover these later on!
