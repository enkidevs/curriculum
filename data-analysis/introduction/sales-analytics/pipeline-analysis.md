# Pipeline Analysis

---
## Content

Sales processes make up a sales **pipeline** or **funnel** and these can be easily tracked using a CRM tool[1].

The sales pipeline will differ across companies but analysis of where leads fall out is vital to improve future sales.

Your pipeline should be a living, breathing list of priorities for your sales team, giving them data points that enable them to win more deals. ðŸ’°

Imagine our sales pipeline is made up of the following stages:

```
New leads --> Call scheduled --> Contacted --> Demo --> Negotiation --> Won
```

On a monthly basis we may have 100 new leads; we schedule calls with 50 of them, but manage to speak to only 30. 10 of these progress to the demo stage, 5 reach negotiation and 3 of those convert to a win!

Using simple analysis we can see that our total **conversion rate** is 3%. This is a useful figure when we want to compare across previous time periods.

**Conversion rates between different stages** of the pipeline also tell a useful story as we can track trends around where leads fall out of the pipeline. 

Other useful sales pipeline analysis metrics include:
- **Number of potential deals**
- **Average deal size** ($)
- **Total pipeline value** ($)
- **Average length of sales cycle**
- **Probability to convert**
- **Lead response time**
- **Sales pipeline velocity**[2]

## Footnotes

[1:CRM tool]
A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool helps companies manage their customer data. It supports sales management, delivers actionable insights, integrates with social media/email and facilitates team communication.

Some of the most popular CRM tools are Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive and Zendesk.

[2:Sales Pipeline Velocity]
HubSpot defines sales pipeline velocity as **the speed at which leads move through your sales pipeline.**

The formula is:

```
(Number of deals in your pipeline) x (overall successful close rate percentage %) x (average deal size in $) 
/ (length of sales cycle in days)
```
