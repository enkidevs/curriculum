# Sales Analysis Tools 

---
## Content

We've already touched on CRMs - these are pretty invaluable tools for tracking key sales metrics and for carrying out pipeline analysis. 

They have all the functionality you could need to get going already built-in. 

There are many out there, so choose one that feels right for your company.

We recommend taking a look at Hubspot, Salesforce, Pipedrive or Zendesk.

CRMs tend to have their own built-in data visualizations, but if you want all of your **data in one place** for additional analysis and you're already using a BI tool, then you can load your CRM data into your BI/Data Visualization tool.

This can be done in many ways, and is often as simple as connecting the data straight from your BI tool.

If you want to build your own CRM from scratch, **Airtable** is your tool. It’s simple to use and totally customizable. Hook it up to Zapier to create automations and integrate it with other apps.

If your website has **Intercom** or other conversation relationship management tools enabled, then sales reps can use live chat to proactively engage, qualify and convert website visitors in real time. 

Intercom allows your sales reps to hop on a discovery call, demo a product or schedule a follow-up meeting with high value leads while they’re live on your website.
