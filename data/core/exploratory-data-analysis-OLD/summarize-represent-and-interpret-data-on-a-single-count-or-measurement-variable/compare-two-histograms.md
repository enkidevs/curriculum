Because histograms give a snapshot view of a the disribution of a one-dimensional dataset, they can be useful for quickly visualizing the differences and similarities between two related distributions.

Suppose you collect the systolic blood pressure of 100 subjects on the Sunday before Thanksgiving and again on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. You would like to visualize whether there is a change in your sample's blood sugar before vs. after the holiday.

When comparing distributions, it is crucial that both are plotted on the same scale, using the same bin boundaries.
