# What is Docker?

---

## Content

Docker is a suite of tools designed to make it easier to create, run and deploy applications in a cross-platform way.

Using Docker we can package our application with all of its dependencies into a single unit, called a _container_.

This containerized application can be tested and built on a developer's local machine, then easily deployed to any Docker-enabled server without the need to re-test or re-adjust the container to the server environment.

The software that was developed and tested is the same software that gets deployed.

> 💡 The core idea of Docker comes down to the following concept: “_develop once, run anywhere_”.

Docker enables separating an application from the infrastructure it will be run on and deployed.

This allows developers to deliver software much more quickly.

Developers can focus on writing the application code without worrying a lot about the system that it will ultimately be running on.
