# Tmpfs

---

## Content

If we are running Docker on Linux, besides bind-mounts and volumes, we can use a third type of storage mechanism called a _tmpfs_ mount.

As opposed to volumes and bind mounts, a _tmpfs_ mount is temporary, and is only persisted in the host memory. When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files written there won't be persisted.

This makes _tmpfs_ mounts suitable for non-persistent state data and will also increase the container's performance since it will not write into the container's writable layer.

Another reason to use _tmpfs_ mounts is for security reasons: if we don't want sensitive data to leak into the host or onto the container's writable layer.

Due to their temporary lifespan, _tmpfs_ mounts cannot be shared among containers.

One way to specify usage of _tmpfs_ is with the `--tmpfs` in the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run --tmpfs ~/enki nginx
```

As with volumes and bind mounts, the recommended approach due to its better readability is to use the `--mount` flag:

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=tmpfs,destination=~/enki nginx
```

## Practice

The _tmpfs_ mount is a storage option in Docker where data is persisted ??? and is available only on ???.

- temporary
- Linux
- forever
- Windows
