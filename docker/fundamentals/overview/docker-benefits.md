# Docker Benefits

---
## Content

There are at least 3 core benefits of using Docker to build and deploy your software.

### 1. Saving resources

Docker is really efficient when it comes to using your system resources, aiming not to use anything beyond the necessary minimum.

With Docker, complex multi-service applications can boot within seconds.

Unlike virtual machines, Docker does not require you to run an entire guest operating system for each unique application. This means that more resources can be dedicated to running your actual app. Ultimately, this means you can run more applications with fewer physical servers.

Not to forget, Docker itself is also free & open source.

### 2. Portability

Applications built with Docker are packaged in a platform-agnostic manner and executed in an isolated environment. This allows them to safely run alongside any other application on any operating system, significantly reducing infrastructure costs.

Docker allows you to build your app once and deploy it anywhere.

### 3. Technology agnostic

Docker does not care which technology (or which version of a particular technology) you develop your application in. It lets you experiment with new frameworks and services without putting you through the pains of technology-specific installation complications.

Instead of polluting your system with a bunch of services that you may not use, Docker allows you to granularly and quickly install only the exact dependencies you need for a particular task.

Docker empowers you to pick whatever technology is best for your project.
