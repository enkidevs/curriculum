# ASCII Art

One way to have fun with ChatGPT is to ask it to create ASCII art.

ASCII art uses a combination of characters to potray pictures or art.

Here's how we can tell ChatGPT to be an ASCII writter:

Now it knows how to respond, so we can only send the objects name.

Here are couple more examples:

Here are "2 cats fighting":

Occasionally, like in the above image, the result might not be what we want, so we have to regenerate our response until we are satisfied.
