# Zero-Shot Prompting

---

## Content

**Zero-shot** prompting is a technique in which a language model is able to generate language output for tasks it has not been explicitly trained on, without any additional training or fine-tuning. 

**Zero-shot** prompting is possible because language models are trained on a large corpus of text, and they can learn to understand the relationships between different concepts and topics.

The key benefit of **zero-shot** prompting is that it allows for generating outputs for new tasks without requiring any additional training data or fine-tuning.

It can be used in various applications, such as language translation:

summarization:

and dialogue generation:
