# ðŸ‘€ Peek into Attention Vectors

---

## Content

Think of attention like a word finding its best friends in a sentence.

Each word creates two lists:
- List 1 describes what kind of friends it's looking for (called a *query vector*)
- List 2 describes what kind of friend it is to other words (called a *key vector*)

> ðŸ’« Words keep track of their friend words and their own characteristics in special lists called *query* and *key vectors*
