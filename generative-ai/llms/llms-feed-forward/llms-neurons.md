# ðŸ§  Neurons

---

## Content

Each word in a feed-forward layer is processed by artificial neurons.

> ðŸ§® A neuron is a mathematical function that takes the word's information as input and transforms it into a strong or a weak numerical signal.

Neurons serve as specialized filters that help identify certain aspects or features of the word.

For example, when processing the word `"cake"` from `"The chef baked a cake"`:

- One neuron might focus on identifying if it's a food-related word
- Another might analyze if it's a concrete object
- Yet another might check if it's something that can be made/created

> ðŸ’¡ An active neuron means it's signal is strong enough to be considered a match.

Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that further strengthens or weakens the signal.
