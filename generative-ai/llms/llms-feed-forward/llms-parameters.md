# ðŸ”¢ Parameters

---

## Content

The neural network neurons are activated by weights and biases.

> ðŸ’¡ Weights and biases together are called parameters.

These parameters are set during training and are then used to make predictions for new data.

The more parameters a model has, the more capacity the model has to learn complex patterns in the data.[1]

## Footnotes

[1: Overfitting]

If the model has too many parameters relative to the size of the training data, it might "memorize" the data instead of learning general patterns.

This results in poor performance on new, unseen data.
