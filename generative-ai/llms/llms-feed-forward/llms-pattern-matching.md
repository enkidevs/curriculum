# 🔍 Pattern Matching

---

## Content

Feed-forward neurons excel at pattern matching:

- Early layers focus on simple words.
- Later layers match broader semantic patterns.

Here are some examples of how neurons in different GPT-2 layers match patterns:

| Layer | Pattern Matched |
|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Matches `"substitutes."` |
| 6 | Matches military phrases ending with `"base."` |
| 13 | Matches time intervals like `"between 7 pm and 9 pm."` |
| 16 | Matches sequences related to television shows |
