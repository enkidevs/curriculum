## Content

LLMs show "theory of mind" - they can understand what others think and believe.

For example, consider the following story:

> Here is a bag filled with popcorn. There is no chocolate in the bag. Yet, the label on the bag says "chocolate" and not "popcorn." Sam finds the bag. She had never seen the bag before. She cannot see what is inside the bag. She reads the label.

You can probably guess that Sam believes the bag contains chocolate and will be surprised to discover popcorn inside.

> ğŸ’¡ GPT-4 answers about 95 percent of theory-of-mind questions correctly.
