# ðŸ§  True Understanding or Stochastic Parrots?

---

## Content

We currently lack clear insight into how LLMs achieve their impressive language capabilities.

Debate exists between those who believe LLMs truly understand meaning vs those who view them as "stochastic parrots".

> ðŸ’¡ A "stochastic parrot" is a model that merely repeats increasingly complex word sequences without truly understanding them.

This philosophical tension may be impossible to fully resolve.

That said, by learning word relationships, LLMs implicitly do learn about the world as good predictions require good representations of the world.
