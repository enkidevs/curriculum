# ðŸ¤– LLMs Predict the Next Word

---

## Content

An LLM predicts the next word based on the words that came before it.

It keeps doing this one word at a time until it completes its response.

For example:

```
The quick brown ___
```

The LLM might predict "fox" because it has learned the common phrase "The quick brown fox."

This process continues, word by word, to form a full response.
