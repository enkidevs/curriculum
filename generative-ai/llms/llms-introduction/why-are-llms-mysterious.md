# 🤔 Why Are LLMs Mysterious?

LLMs don't work like regular programs.

Instead of step-by-step instructions, they're built on neural networks — digital
systems that mimic the way brains process patterns.

We use neural networks because we're inspired by the human brain but we don't
know yet why this design works so well.

Researchers are studying these models to uncover their secrets, but it's a slow
process.

Let's dive deeper into what we do know about LLMs.
