# üèóÔ∏è Layers Build Understanding

---

## Content

LLMs are organized into layers, each refining the meaning of words in context.

The input sentence is converted into a sequence of word vectors and processed by each layer.

Each layer adds clarity to these vectors by identifying syntax, meanings, and relationships.

For example, given `"John wants his bank to cash the"`, the first layer might identify `"wants"` and `"cash"` as verbs, while the second layer clarifies that `"bank"` refers to a financial institution.
