# 🧠 Producing Vectors

---

## Content

Each hidden layer outputs modified word vectors that store accumulated
understanding.

These vectors encode contextual details. For example:

- `bank (financial institution)`
- `his (referring to John)`

This information builds as the sentence passes through layers, sharpening the
model's understanding.
