# ðŸš° Training Faucets

## Content

Imagine a huge wall of faucets - one for each word in the dictionary.

Each faucet represents a different word. Turn on the "cat" faucet, and you're predicting the word "cat".

The goal is simple: make water flow only from the faucet matching the word we want to predict.

Behind this wall is a complex network of pipes connecting all the faucets together.

When water flows from the wrong faucet, we need to trace back through the pipes and carefully adjust the valves.

The tricky part is that each pipe connects to multiple faucets. Adjusting one valve affects many faucets at once, so each change needs to be precise and well-thought-out.

> ðŸ’¡ The "water flow" through pipes (i.e. neurons) is controlled by the valve sizes (i.e. weights) of the connections between them.
