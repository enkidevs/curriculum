# âš¡ Training Phases

---

## Content

Training happens in two steps:

1. Forward pass: The model predicts a word and checks if itâ€™s correct.
2. Backward pass: Backpropagation adjusts weights to improve future predictions.

This process repeats billions of times for each word in the training data.

> ðŸ’¡ This backpropagation process is going back through the pipes to adjust the valves.

## Practice

The ??? pass is the one that adjusts the weights.
The ??? pass is the one that predicts the next word.

## Revision

The process of adjusting the weights is called ???.
