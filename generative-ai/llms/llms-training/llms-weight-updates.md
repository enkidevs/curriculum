# 🔧 Adjusting Weights to Learn

LLMs neurons start with random weights (like random guesses) and improve by adjusting them over billions of examples.

Imagine it like adjusting the temperature of a shower by turning an unmarked faucet.

You turn the faucet to make the water hotter or colder, and each adjustment brings it closer to "just right."

> 💡 For LLMs, this process involves adjusting billions of weights (i.e. parameters).
