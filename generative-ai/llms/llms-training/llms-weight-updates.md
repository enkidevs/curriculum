# ðŸ”§ Adjusting Weights to Learn

---

## Content

LLMs neurons start with random weights (like random guesses) and improve by
adjusting them over billions of examples.

Imagine it like adjusting the temperature of a shower by turning an unmarked
faucet.

You turn the faucet to make the water hotter or colder, and each adjustment
brings it closer to "just right."

> ðŸ’¡ For LLMs, this process involves adjusting billions of weights (i.e. parameters).
