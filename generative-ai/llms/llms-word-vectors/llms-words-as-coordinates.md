# 📍 Words as Coordinates

---

## Content

Words in LLMs are stored as **word vectors**.

These are long lists of numbers that represent a word's position in a "word space."

Think of it like mapping cities to coordinates:

```
London: [51.5, -0.1]
Paris: [48.9, 2.3]
```

Closer coordinates mean the cities are near each other. 

Similarly, the word `"cat"` might be close to `"kitten"` and `"dog"` in word space.
