# 🐾 Word Vectors Have Bias

---

## Content

Word vectors reflect human language—and its biases. 

For instance:

```
Doctor - man + woman = nurse
```

This shows that societal biases present in text can influence the model. 

Researchers are actively working to mitigate such issues but it's still a challenge as LLMs are trained on biased data.
