## Content

Words are too complex to represent in only two coordinates, so LLMs use thousands of them, where each value represents a different aspect of the word.

> 🎯 The name for one coordinate is a **dimension**

For example, one dimension of `"cat"` might represent the concept that `"cats visit vets"`, which will bring the vectors for `"dogs"` or `"kittens"` closer to `"cat"` in word space.

On the other hand, another dimension of "cat" might represent the concept that "cats are mammals", which will bring the vectors for "lion" or "tiger" closer to "cat" in word space.
