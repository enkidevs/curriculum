# Unsupervised Learning Benefits

---
## Content

Unsupervised learning is able to find relationships in data without prior knowledge.

This is useful when dealing with complex datasets where labeled data may be difficult to obtain. 

For example, imagine you have a dataset of customer purchase behavior and you want to understand the underlying patterns. 

Unsupervised clustering can help you group customers into '*frequent buyers*' or '*occasional buyers*' without you needing to create labeled examples.

> 💡 This saves time and resources compared to supervised learning

- organize data into groups
- label data after the training phase
- recognition

## Revision

Let's say that we have a manufacturing plant and want to identify unusual patterns in what may indicate a malfunction but we don't have time to create a robust labeled dataset of what a normal production process looks like.

The appropriate training method for our model would be ??? learning.

- unsupervised
- supervised
- reinforcement
