# Pulling a remote branch


---

## Content

`git pull` is a command that combines `git fetch` and `git merge`.

For example, to fetch and merge the branch `master` with the current branch:

```bash
git pull origin
```

The merge is automatic, and you are unable to review the commits. For this reason, sometimes you can use `git fetch` and `git merge` instead.

There's also the `-a` (shorthand for `--append`) flag targeting the fetch part of pulling. It tells git to append new branch HEADs to the `.git/FETCH_HEAD` file instead of overwriting everything with what's remote.

## Practice

To `fetch` and `merge` master branch automatically you run :

```bash
??? ??? ???
```

* `git`
* `pull`
* `origin`
* `merge`
* `checkout`


---

## Revision

To automatically `merge` the commits from the master branch you would use :

```bash
git ??? origin
```

* `pull`
* `push`
* `get`
* `merge`

## Quiz
