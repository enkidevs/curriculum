# Pushing to a remote branch


---

## Content

If you want to share a branch, you have to push it to the remote. 

To do this, you run `git push <remote> <branch>`. For example, to push a fix:

```bash
git push origin scrollFix
```

If you want to push a local branch into a remote branch but call it by a different name, you can use this format:

```bash
git push origin scrollFix:uiFix
```


---

## Practice

Share a branch `test` with the remote `origin` :

```bash
git ??? ??? ???
```

- `push`
- `origin`
- `test`
- `master`
- `branch`
- `commit`


---

## Revision

Push the branch `test` to the remote under the name `fix` :

```bash
git push origin
         ???:???
```

- `test`
- `fix`
- `rename`
