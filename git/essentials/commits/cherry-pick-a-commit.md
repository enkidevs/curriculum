# Cherry-pick a commit

---
## Content

Cherry-picking is a method to apply a single, specific commit from another branch.

For example:
```bash
git checkout master
git cherry-pick a456bd7
# merge commit a456bd7 (from another branch)
# with branch master
```
This is most useful when you are unable to merge the two branches. For example, you might want to fix a security issue present in both branches.

---
## Practice

The commit cherry-picked in the example was applied on ???.

* master
* other branch

---
## Revision

To apply a *single* commit (from another branch) on the current branch, you use
```bash
git ??? a456bd7
```

* `cherry-pick`
* `pick`
* `merge`
