# How to write a git commit message

---
## Content

You should write a commit message that explains the aim of the commit and why the changes were made.

For simple commits, this is an example of best practice:
```
$ git commit -m "Fix typo in README"
```

For a longer commit, you should leave a line after the subject and include more description in the body of the commit:
```
$ git commit
# commit message editor
Redirect user to the login form

Issue 2034

Users were not redirected to the 
login form, so were unable to access 
the site content.
```

You should stick to a convention that is consistent with the rest of the team.

---
## Practice

Commit the changes with the message "issue no.8 fixed" :
```
$ git ??? ??? 
            ???
```

* `commit`
* `-m`
* `"issue no.8 fixed"`
* -message

---
## Revision

Commit the changes with the message "typo fixed"
```
$ ??? ??? 
        ??? ???
```

* `git`
* `commit`
* `-m`
* `"typo fixed"`
