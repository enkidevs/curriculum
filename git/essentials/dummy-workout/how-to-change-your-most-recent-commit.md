# How to change your most recent commit 

---
## Content

To make changes to your most recent commit use:
```
$ git commit --amend
```
For example, you might want to edit the name of the commit:
```
$ git commit -m 'my first comit'
$ git commit --amend
# editor opens
'my first commit'
```
This is also useful for when you forget to add a file. The `amend` option will use your current staging area to overwrite the previous commit:
```
$ echo "Enki" > README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m 'my first commit'
$ echo "Rocks" >> README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit --amend
# Editor
My first commit
```

The result is a single commit with message `My first commit` and changes to `README.md`:
```
Enki
Rocks
```
The commit with the message `my frst comit` is overridden by a new one.

## Practice

Alter the previous commit to correct the commit message typo
```
$ git commit -m 'Add nwe frmat'
$ git ???
# Editor
'Add new game format'
```
*  commit --amend
*  commit --undo
*  commit --edit

---
## Revision

When would you use `git --amend` ?
```
??? 
```
* To edit the most recent commit.
* To change the content of a file.
* To notify other members of the team.
