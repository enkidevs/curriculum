# How to unmodify a modified file

---
## Content

If you don't want to keep the changes that you've made to a file, you can use `git checkout` to revert to the previous version of the file.

For example:
```
$ git checkout -- MYFILE.md
```
It is not recommended that you use this command unless you are 100% certain. The deleted changes can't be recovered.

You can use **stashing** or **branching** to keep a copy of the changes to a file in case you need to access them at a later date.

## Practice

Why isn't reverting a file to its old version good practice?

???
* The deleted changes can't be recovered.
* It can have unexpected results.
* The command doesn't work on all files.

---
## Revision

Revert `README.md` to its previous version :
```
$ git ??? -- README.md
```
* checkout
* revert
* remove
