# Ignore files in git

---
## Content

To ignore files in git, you put them in a `.gitignore` file. This means git won't include them in your commits or track them in your working directory.

For example, your `.gitignore` file could include Android specific files:
```
# Built application files
*.apk
*.ap_
```

You should commit the `.gitignore` file to your repository.

To ignore a file that only appears on your computer, you can add it to the file `.git/info/exclude` at the root of your git repository.

For example, to ignore files created by your text editor:
```
# Files generated by editor
*~
*.sublime-workspace
*.swp
```
The rules set in `.git/info/exclude` will not be committed.

## Practice

To track the `.gitignore` file youâ€™d run :
```
$ git ??? ???
```
* add
* .gitignore
* track
* -add

---
## Revision

To exclude files from your repository, you have to add them to the ??? file .

* .gitignore
* hooks
* .gitexclude
