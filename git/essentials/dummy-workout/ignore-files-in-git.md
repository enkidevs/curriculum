# Ignore files in git


---

## Content

To ignore files in git, you put them in a `.gitignore` file. This means git won't include them in your commits or track them in your working directory.

For example, your `.gitignore` file could include Android specific files:

    # Built application files
    *.apk
    *.ap_

You should commit the `.gitignore` file to your repository.

To ignore a file that only appears on your computer, you can add it to the file `.git/info/exclude` at the root of your git repository.

For example, to ignore files created by your text editor:

    # Files generated by editor
    *~
    *.sublime-workspace
    *.swp

The rules set in `.git/info/exclude` will not be committed.

## Practice

To track the `.gitignore` file you’d run :

```bash
git ??? ???
```

- add
- .gitignore
- track
- -add


---

## Revision

To exclude files from your repository, you have to add them to the ??? file .

- .gitignore
- hooks
- .gitexclude
