**Viewing**

To list the shortnames of all the remote repositories that you have configured:
```

origin
```
If you use the flag `-v` you can see the URLs associated with each shortname:
```
$ git remote -v
origin https://git.enki.com (fetch)
origin https://git.enki.com (push)
``` 
**Editing**

To change the name of a remote repository from `ol` to `nu`:
```
git remote rename ol nu
```

```
git remote rm nu
```
