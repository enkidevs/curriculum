# The three states in git

---
## Content

In the basic git process, your file can be in one of three states: **modified**, **staged** or **committed**.

First you **modify** a file (e.g. `hello.txt`) in your working directory. 

Then you **stage** the file, which adds a 'snapshot' of it to your staging area:
```
$ git add hello.txt
```

Finally you **commit**, which stores all the staged files in your git repository (a local database):
```
$ git commit -m 'Edit hello.txt'
```
This means the changes you made to `hello.txt` are now saved as a snapshot in the repository.

## Practice

Go through the basic commit process:
```
# enki.md modified
$ git ??? enki.md
$ git ??? ??? 'Changed enki.md'
```

* add
* commit
* -m
* save
* -l
* stage

## Revision

In the basic committing process, what are the three states a file can be found in?
```
$ git status
working directory clean

$ touch README.md
# README.md is ???

$ git add README.md
# README.md is ???

$ git commit -m 'Readme'
# README.md is ???
```

* modified
* staged
* committed
* shared
* saved
