# Get the most out of **Git**

---
## Content

**Git** offers a plethora of tools specifically intended to enhance and make your workflow more flexible.

When you are working you often want to see what has changed. Using the `git diff` command you can see how the working tree (current local state of the files) is different from the `HEAD` (last commit on your branch)[1]:
```
$ git diff
# ...
# - Old line
# + New line
# ...
```
If you want to see the latest commits on all branches simply use[2]:
```
$ git branch -v
# *master 23f2g2e fixed bugs
# feature 249enki implemented share
```
If you don't want to merge or rebase two branches in their entirety, but just want to apply one or more commits from one branch to another, you can use the `git cherry-pick` command:
```
# say you need to apply a commit on master
$ git checkout master
# specify the commit id after the command
$ git cherry-pick 51241js

```

---
## Practice

To just apply a commit without merging or rebase you can use `git ???`.


* `cherry-pick`
* `diff`
* `commit --amend`
* `revert`
* `add`

---
## Revision

Complete the code snippet such that the command, if ran, will show the latest commits on **all** branches:
```
$ git ??? ???
```


* `branch`
* `-v`
* `-all`
* `list`
* `commit`
* `all`
* `diff`

## Footnotes
[1: diff command]
Instead of seeing the differences for all the files, you can specify a file the command will target:
```
$ git diff thisFile.txt
```
To see the difference between two branches you can use the following syntax:
```
$ git diff <source_branch> <target_branch>
```

[2: branch command]

The `*`(asterisk) marks the branch you are currently on.
