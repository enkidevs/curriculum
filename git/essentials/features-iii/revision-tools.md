## Content

To specify a range of commits that can be reached by different branches you can use `^`, `--not`, double dots (`..`) and triple dots (`...`).

These are equivalent:
```
$ git log master..tests
$ git log ^master tests
$ git log tests --not master
# shows commits on the tests
# branch that are not on master
```
Triple dots are used to show commits that are in one branch but not in both:
```
$ git log master...tests
# shows all commits that aren't
# shared history
```

## Practice

```
$ git log master...myBranch
```
Would print commits that

???


* Are in either one of them, but not in both
* Are in master, but not in myBranch
* Are in myBranch, but not in master
* Are in both of them

---
## Revision

```
$ git log ^master myBranch
```
Is equivalent to

???


* `git log master..myBranch`
* `git log master...myBranch`
* `git log --not master myBranch`
