# Useful commit hooks

---
## Content

Two useful hooks which fire during a commit are `pre-commit` and `post-commit`.

`pre-commit`

This hook runs before you even type in a commit message. You can use it to check the changes you're about to make.

`post-commit`

This hook fires when the commit process ends. You can use it to send an email notification to the team about the new commit.

---
## Revision

Hooks can be attached to the pre-commit and ???-commit phases.
