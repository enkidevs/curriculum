# What is a hook?

---
## Content

A hook is a custom script that automatically fires when certain actions occur.

Actions such as committing and merging fire client-side hooks. Network operations fire server-side hooks.

You can write a hook in bash, perl, ruby, python or any other scripting language.

If you run `git init` git will add examples to the hooks directory `.git/hooks`.

For example, the hook called `post-commit` is useful for sending an email notification when there has been a new commit.
