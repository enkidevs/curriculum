# Branches in Git

---
## Content

Branching allows developers to diverge from the main line of development without affecting other work.

Branching in **Git** differs dramatically from other VCS and is considered its "killer feature". Branches in **Git** are considered lightweight and simple.  For that reason branching, which is 'feared' in other VCS is highly encouraged in **Git**.

Understanding and mastering this is paramount to proficiency and expertise with **Git**.

Conceptually, a branch is divergence at a specific point from your working tree[1]

Changes (technically commits) are added to the history of the current branch, resulting in a fork[2] in the project history.
In practice, a branch is merely a **pointer** to a specific commit object.

With the `git branch` command you can create, edit, rename and remove branches.

Branches are often used as a "reference" when working with `git merge`[3] and `git checkout`.

To list all your branches:
```bash
$ git branch
* develop
new-feature
master
```

Create a new branch:
```bash
$ git branch my-branch
# will not switch to it

```
Delete a branch:
```bash
$ git branch -d my-branch
# unmerged changes will stop this
$ git branch -D my-branch
# will force delete
```
To rename the current branch:
```bash
$ git branch -m new-branch-name

```
Thinking of a branch as a pointer to a specific state of the repository, We can visualize how changing to a different branch takes us to a different stage of the same project. different changes of the same project are stored on different branches. To change the branch, we are on we can use `git checkout`[4]:
```
$ git checkout my-branch
```

## Practice

Complete the command below in order to force the delete of `my-branch`:
```
$ git ??? ??? my-branch
```


* `branch`
* `-D`
* `-d`
* `-f`
* `force`
* `-m`
* `checkout`

## Revision

What command is used in **Git** to switch between branches?

???


* `git checkout`
* `git branch`
* `git branch -m`

## Footnotes
[1:working tree]
The **working tree** consist of files that you are currently working on.



[2:fork]
A **fork** is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.


[3:merging]
**Merging** is the operation of combining different lines of development (branches) into a single one.


[4:checkout]
Using the `git checkout` command together with the `-b` flag, you can simultaneously create a new branch and switch to it:
```bash
$ git checkout -b my-branch

```
