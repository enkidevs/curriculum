# The Git working tree

---
## Content

During the development process, a project can grow to thousands of files.

Those files you are currently working on - and changes that may not be committed as part of a **Git** repository - constitute the **working tree**.  Some of these files _may be_ part of a previous commit, but in a different form.

The **working tree** represents files that have been **created**, **updated** or **modified** and diverge from the contents of the most recent commit.

**Tracked** files in the working tree are represented in **Git** based on different statuses:
  - `modified` or `dirty` : the file is changed, but Git has yet to calculate the differences and label the versions.
  - `staged` : differences are calculated and the new structure of the project can be saved.
  - `committed` : the new version is safely stored in the repository.

A user can add the changes to a repository at any point through **commits**, but also **revert** those changes.
