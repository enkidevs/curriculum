# Initializing a Git repository

---
## Content

There are two primary ways to include a project under **Git** control:
1. Bring an existing project/directory on your machine under control of **Git**
2. Import a **Git** repository from another server by *cloning* it


 From within a project's directory:
```bash
$ cd myAwesomeProject

```

You can simply:
```bash
$ git init 
```

This will create a (hidden) `.git` subdirectory, enabling **Git** to manage your source files.
