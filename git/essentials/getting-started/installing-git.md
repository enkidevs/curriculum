# Installing Git

---
## Content

To be able to use **Git**, it first must be available on your machine. You can install **Git** in various ways, depending on your Operating System.

**Git** is available to download together with installing instructions from the official **Git** website for *Linux* , *Windows* or *Mac OSX*.


### Mac OS X


You can install **Git** by running `git` from the terminal, which will prompt you to proceed with the installation if your OS version is at least `10.9.`


### Linux

Depending on your Linux distribution and package management tool you can install **Git**:
- using `yum` on Fedora/Red Hat:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

- using `apt` on Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Windows

When working on Windows, there are multiple ways of installing Git. The easiest way is installing GitHub Desktop, which comes with a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. All you have to do is go to their [website](https://desktop.github.com/), download and install GitHub Desktop.

Another option is installing Git for Windows, which brings the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows. Go to the [official website](https://git-scm.com/download/win) which will automatically start downloading the Windows installer, followed by installing Git for Windows.

If you install the *GitHub* client application (repository hosting service), which is available on all leading operating systems, **Git** will also be installed on your machine.
