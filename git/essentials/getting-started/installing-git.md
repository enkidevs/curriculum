# Installing Git

---
## Content

In order to be able to use **Git**, it first must be available on your machine. You can install **Git** in various ways, depending on your Operating System.

**Git** is available for downloading together with installing instructions from the official **Git** website for *Linux* , *Windows* or *Mac OSX*.


### Mac OS X


You can install **Git** by:
- running `git` from the terminal will prompt you to the installation if your OS version is at least `10.9`


### Linux

Depending on your Linux distribution and package management tool you can install **Git**:
- using `yum` on Fedora/Red Hat:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

- using `apt` on Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

If you install the *GitHub* client application (repository hosting service), which is available on all main operating systems, **Git** will also be installed on your machine.
