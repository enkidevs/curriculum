# Benefits of Git

---
## Content

Let's talk a bit about what **Git** brings to the table.

1. Apart from syncing changes, everything can be done locally.

2. Each *clone* has a full history of changes.

3. Something happened with the main version? **Recreate it** using a local version.

4. It seems your new code introduces an unforseen bug. **Revert** the change until you find a fix.

5. **Flexible**. It's not just for developers! You can also use it in *marketing*, *design*, and *HR* for example.
