# Installing Git


---

## Content

To be able to use **Git**, it first must be available on your machine. You can install **Git** in various ways, depending on your Operating System.

**Git** is available to download together with installing instructions from the official **Git** website for *Linux* , *Windows* or *Mac OSX*.

### Mac OS X

You can install **Git** by running `git` from the terminal, which will prompt you to proceed with the installation if your OS version is at least `10.9.`

### Linux

Depending on your Linux distribution and package management tool you can install **Git**:

- using `yum` on Fedora/Red Hat:

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

- using `apt` on Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Windows

There are multiple ways of installing Git on Windows. The easiest way is to install GitHub Desktop, which comes with a command line version of Git as well as the GUI. 

Just go to their [website](https://desktop.github.com/), where you can download and install GitHub Desktop.

Another option is to install Git for Windows, which brings the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows. 

Go to the [official website](https://git-scm.com/download/win) which will automatically start downloading the Windows installer, followed by installing Git for Windows.

If you install the *GitHub* client application (repository hosting service), which is available on all leading operating systems, **Git** will also be installed on your machine.
