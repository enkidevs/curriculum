# Why Git?


---

## Content

Before **Git**, the main type of version control was centralized. 

To make any changes to a project, you had to:

1. Get all previous changes from the central server
2. Edit the files and make sure they work.
3. Send all the changes to the central server.

With **Git**, every developer can have *their own copy* of the project. This is called **Distributed Version Control System** (or DVCS).

Let's say your software is at version `v2.1` with the next release being `v3`. Your users have reported a bug in `v2.1`, but the release of `v3` is a couple weeks away.

Git lets you copy (or **clone**) `v2.1`, fix the bug and release `v2.1.1`. All of this without touching `v3`. This is due to how **branching** works, and we'll explain this soon.
