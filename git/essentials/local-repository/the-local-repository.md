# The local repository

---
## Content

Your local **Git** project is made of three main areas:

- working directory 
- staging area (also known as **Index**)
- the `.git` directory (the repository)

#### Working tree

The working tree is the place where all files exist. This is always a **single** checkout of one project's versions.

#### Staging area

Unlike most VCSs, **Git** has an additional step between the working copy (directory) and the data store (repository). This place is the staging area and lets you decide what changes are included in a commit.

#### Repository
The repository is the proprietary datastore where **Git** maintains the **history** of the project (all commit objects, tags, and a lot more).
