# Tracking and Staging files

---
## Content

You can easily check the status of your files inside a **Git** project with the `git status` command:
```
$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is up-to-date with
# 'origin-master'.
# nothing to commit, working directory
# clean
```
The message in the code snippet above is shown when there are no *tracked* and *modified* files.

Let's suppose you add `enki.txt` to your project. Running the same command you will see a different result: 
```bash
$ git status
# On branch develop
# You branch ...
# Untracked files:
#     enki.txt
# nothing added to commit ...
```
You can see that the `enki.txt` file is **untracked**. In order for **Git** to manage changes in this file (track it) you must use the `git add` command:
```
$ git add enki.txt
```
In case you need to add more than a single file, naming them one by one isn't going to work out. Here are your options for adding multiple files:
```bash
# stages everything
$ git add [-A|--all]
$ git add .
# stages everything but new files
$ git add [-u|--update]
```
Running `git status` again, we can see that the file is now **staged** and ready to be part of a **commit**:
```
$ git status
# ...
# Changes to be committed:
#    new file:    enki.txt

```
