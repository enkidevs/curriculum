# Pushing

---
## Content

**Pushing** is the way to share/push upstream your work on a remote repository.

The basic syntax of the `git push` command is:
```
$ git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
```
If you want to push all your local commits to the `origin` server on the `master` branch (both automatically named) you can use:
```
$ git push origin master
```


You can also run `git push` without arguments to push to the upstream of your current local branch. 

If, for example, you are on `feature` branch and you want to set its upstream you need to use the `--set-upstream` flag:

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin feature
```
This will create, if it doesn't already exist, a new remote branch called `feature`, and push all your changes there.

Keep in mind that the `git push` command only works if you have **write** permissions to the remote repository.

If the **history** differs from your local - due to somebody pushing changes since your last **pull** or **fetch** - your push will be rejected. To fix this, you must first `fetch`, `merge` (or just `pull`) their work. Your push will be accepted once all merging conflicts are resolved.
