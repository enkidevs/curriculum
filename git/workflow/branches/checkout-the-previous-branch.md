# Checkout the previous branch


---

## Content

There is a shorthand to checkout the previous branch:

```bash
git checkout -
```

This is the same as:

```bash
git checkout @{-1}
```

The shorthand is useful if you want to switch back and forth between a `master` branch and a feature branch.
This is similar to the *nix `cd -` command.
