# Checkout the previous branch

---
## Content

There is a shorthand to checkout the previous branch:
```bash
git checkout -
```
This is the same as:
```bash
git checkout @{-1}
```
The shorthand is useful if you want to switch back and forth between a `master` branch and a feature branch.
This is similar to the *nix `cd -` command.
