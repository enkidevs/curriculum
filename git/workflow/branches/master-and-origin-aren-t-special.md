# master and origin aren't special


---

## Content

`master` and `origin` are widely used in git, but they aren't special values. They are just the default names when you use the commands `init` and `clone`.

If you start to track an existing project:

```bash
git init
```

The default name for the branch is `master`.

If you clone a remote repository:

```bash
git clone https://git.enki.com
```

The default name for the remote is `origin`.
