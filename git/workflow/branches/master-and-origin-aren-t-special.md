# `master` and `origin` aren't special

---
## Content

`master` and `origin` are widely used in git, but they aren't special values. They are just the default names when you use the commands `init` and `clone`.

If you start to track an existing project:
```
$ git init
```
The default name for the branch is `master`.

If you clone a remote repository:
```
$ git clone https://git.enki.com
```
The default name for the remote is `origin`.
