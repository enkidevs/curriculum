# Prune remote tracking references

---
## Content

You may have references to old remote branches in your local repository.

Use `--prune` to remove references to branches that have been deleted from the remote server:
```
$ git fetch origin --prune
```
This will clean up your log.

---
## Practice

Remove references to deleted branches:
```
$ git ??? origin ???
```

* `fetch`
* `--prune`
* `prune`
* `--fetch`

---
## Revision

```
$ git fetch origin --prune
```
Removes references to ??? branches.

* deleted
* merged
* existing
