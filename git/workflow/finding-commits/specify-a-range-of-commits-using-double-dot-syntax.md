# Specify a range of commits using double dot syntax

---
## Content

The double dot syntax specifies all commits that you can reach from one branch but not another, i.e. unmerged commits.

For example to see the commits on `test` that are not on `master`:
```
$ git log master..test
de23f12 Add new game style
fe67de1 Edit game list
```
You can use this to see what you're going to push to a remote:
```
$ git log origin/master..HEAD
```
This will show the commits that are on your current branch but not on the remote.

---
## Practice

In order to see the commits that are on `awesomeFeature` branch but not on `master`, you have to run:
```
$ git ???
      ??? ??? ???
```

* `log`
* `master`
* `..`
* `awesomeFeature`
* `.`
* `test`

---
## Revision

```
$ git log origin/master..HEAD
```
shows ??? that are on the ??? branch, but not on ??? .

* commits
* current
* master
* main
* snippets
