# Getting help

---
## Content

If ever in need, you can easily access the manual pages (**manpage**) of **Git** to get the documentation of specific commands.

There are three ways to access the manpage for a command:
```bash
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
```

Note how in the last command, using the `man` command, the syntax enforced is `git-<verb>` and not `git <verb>`. Running the latter will get you the main manpage of `git`.

For example to get the manpage of the `clone` command you can run:
```
$ git help clone
$ git clone --help
$ man git-clone


NAME
git-clone - Clone a repository into a
            new directory
...
```

Additional help can be found on the `#git` and `#github` channels in the Freenode IRC server (`irc.freenode.net`).

## Practice

Complete the command such that it will show you the *manpage* of `git branch` command:
```
$ ??? ???-???

```


* `man`
* `git`
* `branch`
* `help`
* `--help`

---
## Revision

What flag can you use after a git command to show its documentation?
```
$ git clone ???
```


* `--help`
* `--manpage`
* `help`
* `--man`
* `--info`
