# How to unstage a staged file

---
## Content

If you mistakenly stage a file and want to 'undo' this operation, you can use `git reset`.

For example:
```
$ git add *
# mistakenly staged all files
$ git reset HEAD README.txt
# unstaged README.txt 
```
You can use `git status` for prompts on unstaging.

## Practice

What do these commands do?
```
$ git add enki.md games.md
$ git reset 
```
 ???


* Unstage `enki.md` and `games.md`
* Unstage `games.md`
* Delete `enki.md` and `games.md`

---
## Revision

Undo the command that staged `index.html` :
```
$ git add index.html
$ git ??? HEAD index.html
```

* `reset`
* `remove`
* `amend`
