# How to unstage a staged file


---

## Content

If you mistakenly stage a file and want to 'undo' this operation, you can use `git reset`.

For example:

```bash
git add *
# mistakenly staged all files
git reset HEAD README.txt
# unstaged README.txt 
```

You can use `git status` for prompts on unstaging.

## Practice

What do these commands do?

```bash
git add enki.md games.md
git reset 
```

 ???

* Unstage `enki.md` and `games.md`
* Unstage `games.md`
* Delete `enki.md` and `games.md`


---

## Revision

Undo the command that staged `index.html` :

```bash
git add index.html
git ??? HEAD index.html
```

* `reset`
* `remove`
* `amend`
