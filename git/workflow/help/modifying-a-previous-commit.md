# Modifying a Previous Commit

---
## Content

Forgot something in your last **commit**?

 No problem, **Git** provides an easy way to update your last commit: the `--amend` flag of the `git commit` command.

Suppose you staged some changes and then committed them:
```
$ git commit -m "my commit"
```
If you forgot to add some changes, you can stage them normally:
```
$ git add path/to/my/new/file.txt
```

Now, to update your last commit just run:
```
$ git commit --amend -m "my updated commit"
```

Voila, the commit has been updated. Without  the `add` step, the command will only change the commit's message. 

Keep in mind that updating a commit will trigger a change in its `ID` as well. Effectively, you are creating a new commit that replaces the old one.

To get a file to the state it was when you last committed you can also use the following command:
```
$ git checkout -- file.txt
```

Running this, you'll be copying a "new" file that overwrites the target file, losing any uncommitted changes.
