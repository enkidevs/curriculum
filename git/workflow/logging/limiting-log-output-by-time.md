# Limiting log output by time


---

## Content

By default `git log` shows the whole commit history, with the most recent commit first.

You can limit this output to a specific time period by using `--since/--after` and `--until/--before`. 

For example, to show commits in the past month:

```bash
git log --since="last month"
```

Many different formats are accepted, for example relative dates ("3 hours ago"), ISO 8601 and RFC 2822 formats, and "YYYY-MM-DD".


---

## Practice

Show the commits between 01/01/2016 and 05/01/2016 (DD/MM/YYYY) :

```bash
git ??? 
  --???="2016-01-01" 
  --???="2016-01-05"
```

* `log`
* `after`
* `before`
* `start`
* `end`


---

## Revision

Show the commits made today :

```bash
git ??? ???
```

* `log`
* `--since="yesterday"`
* `--pretty`
* `--since`
* `"yesterday"`
