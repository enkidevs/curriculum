## Content

If you want to see a visual representation of your branching and merging, you can use the `--graph` option of `git log`.

Combined with `--pretty` it produces a nicer output:

```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph
* fe341a0 Change game colours 
*  5e3ee11 Merge branch master
|\
| * 420eac9 Add new game style
* | e34f120 Fix typo in index.html
|/
* ab56e1c Update README
```
