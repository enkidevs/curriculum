# Solving basic merge conflicts


---

## Content

Merge conflicts occur when the same part of the code has been modified in both branches.

For example, if the same line of `README.md` is edited in `fix` and `master`:

```bash
git merge fix
# conflict with README.md
# merge failed
```

The file impacted will have conflict-resolution markers (`<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`) added to it by git, showing the conflicting lines (separated by `=======`). Opening `README.md` in a text editor:

```bash
To contact us email:
<<<<<<< HEAD
hello@enki.com
=======
help@enki.com
>>>>>>> fix
```

You have to choose the option you want or combine them manually.
.

Then run `git add` to mark the file as resolved. When you are done resolving conflicts finalize the merge with `git commit`.

## Practice

Solve this merge conflict.

```bash
git ??? test
# merge failed

# open testing.js to resolve issues
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log(a);
=======
console.log(b);
>>>>>>> test

git ??? testing.js
```

- `merge`
- `add`
- `rm`
- `commit`
