# The golden rule of rebasing

---
## Content

Rebasing is the process of modifying the base commit from which a series of commits stems. This is achieved with the `git rebase` command. Rebasing is an alternative to **merging** when wanting to combine two different branches of development.
> **Only rebase commits that exist in your local repository.** 

You should stick to this rule so that other people contributing to the project don't end up with a confusing history when you rebase something they've based their code on. 

If someone does rebase shared commits, you can run:
```
$ git pull --rebase
```
and git will attempt to work out a simple history.

## Practice

How would you make git to recreate a history of commits if someone rebased shared commits?
```
$ git ??? ???
```

* `pull`
* `--rebase`
* `rebase`
* `commit`

---
## Revision

The best practice is to only `rebase` commits that exist in your ??? ???.

* local
* repository
* remote
