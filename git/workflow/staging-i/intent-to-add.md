# Intent to add

---
## Content

You can use the `-N` flag to show that you are going to track a file in the future:
```
$ git add -N file.txt
```
Once git knows you are intending to add the untracked file, you can use commands like `git diff` on the file without any problems, as well as commit it using `git commit -a`.

---
## Practice

Show that you intend to track `enki.md` :
```
$ git ??? ??? enki.md
```

* `add`
* `-N`
* `-n`
* `stage`
* `track`
