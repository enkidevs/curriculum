# Interactive staging

---
## Content

To stage a file interactively, use the `-i` or `--interactive` option:
```
$ git add -i
     staged     unstaged path
  1: unchanged    +0/-1 README
  2: unchanged    +1/-1 index.html
*** Commands ***
1:status 2:update 3:revert 4:add untracked
5:patch 6:diff 7:quit 8:help
What now >
```
This will open an interactive shell. It will show your staged and unstaged files and present a list of commands.

To stage a file type `2` and hit **Enter**:
```
What now > 2
staged     unstaged path
1: unchanged    +0/-1 README
2: unchanged    +1/-1 index.html
```
You have now selected the `update` command. All is left to do is stating the index of the file you are looking to stage. To choose the **README** file, type *1*:
```
Update > 1
       staged     unstaged path
* 1: unchanged    +0/-1 README
  2: unchanged    +1/-1 index.html
Update >
# hitting Enter again stages README
```

## Practice

To stage `enki.md`, you would press
```
What now > 2
       staged     unstaged path
  1: unchanged    +0/-1 index.md
  2: unchanged    +1/-1 enki.md
Update > ???
       staged     unstaged path
  1: unchanged    +0/-1 index.md
|*2: unchanged    +1/-1 enki.md
```

* `2`
* `enki.md`
* `stage`
