# Interactively stage patches


---

## Content

To partially stage a file:

```bash
git add -p
# or
git add --patch
```

Alternatively, when performing an interactive stage, you can type `5` (patch) in the interactive shell.

Once you have selected a file, git will display hunks of the file diff and then ask:

```plain-text
Stage this hunk [y,n,a,d,/,j,J,g,e,?]? >
```

You can then choose yes `y`, no `n` or other options such as skipping a hunk.
