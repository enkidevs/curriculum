# Use `short` status to make output more compact

---
## Content

You can use the option `-s` or `--short` to get a simplified status output.

For example:
```
$ git status --short
  M README
M   LICENSE
A   CONTRIBUTING
??  emoji.png
```
`M` means that the file has been modified. If the `M` letter is in the right hand column it has not been staged, if it is in the left hand column it has been.

`??` means that a new file has been created and is not yet tracked.

`A` describes a new file that has been staged.

## Practice

What does this tell us about the file `enki.md`?
```
$ git status --short
M  enki.md
 M hello.md
```
???

* `enki.md` is modified and staged
* `enki.md` is modified and not staged
* `enki.md` is a new untracked file
* `enki.md` is a new staged file
