# Create a new branch from a stash


---

## Content

If you want to test out a stash before you apply it to its original branch, you can use the `branch` option:

```bash
git stash branch testing
```

This will create a branch `testing` and checkout the commit you were on when you made the stash. It will then apply the changes and delete the stash if it was successful.


---

## Practice

You can test stashed code using a new branch “testing”:

```bash
git ??? ??? ???
```

- `stash`
- `branch`
- `testing`
- `-stash`
- `new`


---

## Revision

```bash
git stash branch newBranch
```

Applies the ??? changes to a new ??? before merging them into the old one.

- stashed
- branch
- commit
- merged
