# Delete all untracked files

---
## Content

Use `git clean` to remove untracked files from your local repository.

To delete untracked files in the current directory:
```
$ git clean -f
```

To remove untracked directories:
```
$ git clean -f -d
```

You also can clean the working directory interactively by using the `-i` flag:
```
$ git clean -f -i
```

You can use `-n` to have a dry-run of the operation and display the results without actually deleting anything.

## Practice

Remove the untracked files in your current directory :
```
$ git ??? ???
```

* `clean`
* `-f`
* `-m`
