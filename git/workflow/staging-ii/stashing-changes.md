# Stashing changes

---
## Content

If you want to switch branches but aren't ready to commit the work on your current branch, you can stash the changes on the stack:
```bash
git stash
Saved working directory and index state
"WIP on master: bc43f10 Edit index.html"
```
Your working directory will now be clean and you can switch branches.

To view current list of stashes:
```bash
git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on master: bc43f10 
 Edit index.html
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c26ded3
 Add new game style
```
To apply a stash:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```
You don't have to apply the stash to the same branch you made it on. git will get you to merge any conflicts to apply it cleanly.

To remove a stash from the stack:
```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

You can apply the stash and remove it from the list in one command:
```bash
git stash pop
```

---
## Practice

You can stash code more than once on the same branch. To see all the existing stashes you have to run:

```bash
??? ??? ???
```

* `git`
* `stash`
* `list`
* `pop`
* `apply`

---
## Revision

```bash
git stash ???
```

 applies the last stash and removes it from the list.

* `pop`
* `apply`
* `list`
