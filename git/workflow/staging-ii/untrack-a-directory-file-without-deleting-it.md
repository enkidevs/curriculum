# Untrack a directory/file without deleting it

---
## Content

To delete a file from your project in git you use `git rm`.

However, if you only want to remove the file from the index but not the working directory, use instead:
```
$ git rm --cached myFile
# untrack myFile
```
You can do the same for a directory:
```
$ git rm --cached -r myDirectory
# untrack myDirectory
```

---
## Practice

Untrack the directory `experiment` :
```
$ git ??? ??? ??? 
                  experiment
```

* `rm`
* `--cached`
* `-r`
* `-m`
* `-t`

## Revision

What is the flag to remove a file from cache, but not from the working directory?
```
$ git rm ??? enki.html
```

* `--cached`
* `-d`
* `-m`
* `--index`
