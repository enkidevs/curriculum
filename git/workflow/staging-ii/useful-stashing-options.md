# Useful stashing options

---
## Content

To only stash files that are not staged:
```
$ git stash --keep-index
```
To stash untracked files as well as tracked:
```
$ git stash -u
```
To interactively stash the changes:
```
$ git stash --patch
```
To clean up your working directory but not delete the changes permanently:
```
$ git stash --all
```

Finally, there is an optional `message` argument to give a description of the stash:
```
$ git stash save new feature
$ git stash list
stash@{0}: On master: new feature
```
