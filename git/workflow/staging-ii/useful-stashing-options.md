# Useful stashing options

---
## Content

To only stash files that are not staged:
```bash
git stash --keep-index
```
To stash untracked files as well as tracked:
```bash
git stash -u
```
To interactively stash the changes:
```bash
git stash --patch
```
To clean up your working directory but not delete the changes permanently:
```bash
git stash --all
```

Finally, there is an optional `message` argument to give a description of the stash:
```bash
git stash save new feature
git stash list
stash@{0}: On master: new feature
```

---
## Practice

Select the `git stash` option that stashes:

tracked and untracked files ???  
unstaged files ???  
interactively ???  

* -u
* --keep-index
* --patch

---
## Revision

`new feature` in `git stash save new feature` represents a ??? of the stash.

* description
* branch
* message
