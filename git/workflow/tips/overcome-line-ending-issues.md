# Overcome line-ending issues

---
## Content

Windows uses a carriage-return character and a linefeed character (CRLF) for new lines in files, whereas Mac and Linux systems use a linefeed character (LF).

To make sure the files in the team's shared repository have LF endings and to prevent problems when you checkout to Windows, you can set `core.autocrlf`.

On Windows:
```
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
On Mac and Linux:
```
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

---
## Practice

Enable `core.autocrlf` on Windows:
```
$ git ??? ???
      ??? ???
```

* `config`
* `--global`
* `core.autocrlf`
* `true`

---
## Revision

To enable `core.autocrlf`, its value should be set to:
- Windows   ???
- Linux/Mac   ???


* true
* input
* start
* -true
