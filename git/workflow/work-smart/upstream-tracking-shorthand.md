# Upstream (tracking) shorthand

---
## Content

You can reference an upstream tracked branch with the `@{upstream}` or `@{u}` shorthand. 

For example:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge origin/master
```
can be replaced by:

```
git checkout master
git merge @{u}
```

---
## Practice

`@{u}` refers to ??? in the following snippet:
```
$ git checkout myBranch
$ git merge @{u}
#upstream equivalent of myBranch
```

* origin/myBranch
* myBranch
* origin/master

---
## Revision

`@{u}` is used to reference the 

???

* upstream tracked branch
* downstream tracked branch
* master branch
