## Content

**GitHub** is the most popular hosting solution for **Git** repositories. It provides tooling and reliable solutions for version control hosting and is used by millions of developers worldwide.

In addition to **Git**'s distributed version control and source code management capabilities, **GitHub** provides:
 - access control (repositories can be either `public` or `private`)
 - bug tracking
 - feature requests
 - task management
 - wiki pages for all projects
 - kanban boards
 - statistics
 - static website hosting etc.

Because projects uploaded to **GitHub** are not required to meet the **Open Source Definition**, users are advised to choose the license of every project individually to meet their specific needs.

Founded in `2007` and continuously improving, **GitHub** is the most notable place for hosting users' work and enhancing their workflow. It is often considered the Hub of Open Source collaboration and technology learning.
