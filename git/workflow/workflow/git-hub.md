## Content

**GitHub** is the most popular hosting solution for **Git** repositories. It is used by millions of developers worldwide as it provides reliable solutions and additional tools for working with **Git** repositories.

In addition to **Git**'s distributed version control and source code management capabilities, **GitHub** provides:
 - access control (repositories can be either `public` or `private`)
 - bug tracking
 - feature requests
 - task management
 - wiki pages for all projects
 - static website hosting etc.

Any repository on your account (**public** or **private**) can be cloned through the action called a `fork`.

Because projects uploaded to, **GitHub** are not required to meet the **Open Source Definition**, and users are advised to choose the license of every project individually to meet their needs.

Founded in `2007` and continuously improving **GitHub** is the most notable place for hosting users' work and enhancing their workflow. It is the Hub of Open Source collaboration and technology learning.
