# Squashing commits


---

## Content

If you contribute to an open source project, e.g., by submitting a pull request with a bug fix, it should be presented as one unit of code.

You should **squash** your commits together. For example, if you have three commits:

```bash
git reset HEAD~3
git add .
git commit -am "Fix bug #14"
git push --force
```

The `--force` option is needed if the commits have already been pushed, for them to be replaced. **Beware** that this overwrites the previous history so always avoid when possible.

By squashing you can get rid of `"fix typo"` commits and have all your changes grouped in just one commit. This will keep the maintainer happy!
