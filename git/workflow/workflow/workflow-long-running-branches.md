# Workflow: long running branches

---
## Content

Long running branches are branches that you create to work on for the long-term.

For example, the branch `master` could be for stable code and `develop` for testing.

You could create a fix to a new issue on the topic branch `iss14`. You could merge this with `develop` and test its stability:
```
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge iss14
# merge into develop
# test the stability
```
If the fix proves to be stable, you could then merge with `master`.

This can be helpful in large, complex projects.
