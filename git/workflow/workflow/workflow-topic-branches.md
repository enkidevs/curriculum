# Workflow: topic branches


---

## Content

A topic branch is a branch that you create and use for work on a feature.

The idea is to work on a fix or an experiment separately from the `master` branch. This makes it easier to review changes, as all the commits related to one topic.

For example, you could work on solving an issue:

```bash
git checkout -b iss14
# checkout as a new branch "iss14"
# fix the issue
```

Once you have solved the problem you can merge it into the master branch:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge iss14
# merge the fix
```

Then you can delete the topic branch:

```bash
git branch -d iss14
```


---

## Practice

Create a new branch :

```bash
git ??? ??? newFeature
```

* `checkout`
* `-b`
* `branch`
* `-d`

## Revision

A way of keeping the master branch clean and safely experimenting is by using ??? .

* branches 
* merges
* IDEs
