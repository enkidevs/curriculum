# Base64 Encoding

In computers, files are commonly stored in binary format (strings of 0's and 1's) but data on the internet is usually transferred as text.

Base64 represents a way to convert binary data into text using 64 [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters.

It is predominantly used on the web for encoding files such as images or sounds into textual formats native to the web such as HTML and CSS.

A Base64 character can be an English alphabet letter or the `+`, `/` or `=` sign. Check out the full [conversion table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Base64_table).
