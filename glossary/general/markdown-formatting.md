# Markdown Formatting

Just as we use punctuation to improve readability, we can use markdown to format text in our comment section.

Before you leave your first submission, it might help to brush up your markdown.

When submitting an answer in the comment section, you'll want to use something like this:

```py
print("So this is markdown!")
```

That is called a code block. To write it, you start with ` ``` ` and end with ` ``` `, just like this:

``````md
```python
# your code
# goes here
```
``````

Notice how we also include `python` after the first ` ``` `. This enables syntax highlighting, which is a way to colour different parts of the code to make it more readable.

Depending on what you are learning, you can use the following tags: `python`, `javascript`, `sql`, `html`, `css`, `java`, `go`, `bash`, `git`, `docker`, `jsx` or `plain-text`.

When you're leaving a comment, you can press the `M⬇` button for a markdown cheat-sheet.

You can also press the eye button to preview your comment.
