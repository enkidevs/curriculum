# Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that works with real-life entities. These entities are called objects, and they have attributes and behaviors.

Let's use the common car analogy to better understand OOP.

Think of the car as the object. The model, color or age of the car are the object's attributes. Whether the engine is on, or whether it's moving are behaviors and would exist as methods.
