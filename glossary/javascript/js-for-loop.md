# For

A `for` loop is used when you want to execute a piece of code a specified number of times.


```javascript
// Create variable i, set the condition to "as long as i is less than 3", increase i by 1 after every loop cycle
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // Code that is executed on every cycle
  console.log("The current value of i is", i, ".");
}
```
