# If else

An `if` is a conditional statement that executes a piece of code if the condition is `true`.

An `else` statement is used after the `if` and it executes the code if the `if` condition evaluates to `false`.

`if-else` statements can be chained.

```python
number = 3

if (number > 3):
  print("number is greater than", number)
elif (number < 3):
  print("number is smaller than", number)
else:
  print("number is equal to", number)
```
