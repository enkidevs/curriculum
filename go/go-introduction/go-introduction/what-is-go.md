# Meet Go


---

## Content

Go is a [statically typed](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/statically-typed), fast [compiled](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/compilation), and [open-source](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/open-source) language designed by Google.

> ðŸ’¡ A common name for Go is **Golang** because of its website [golang.org](https://golang.org). The domain name go.org wasn't available when the language was created.

**Golang** was created because the developers at Google wanted to make a new language that supports modern multicore machines and large codebases.

The design of **Golang** aims to have the readability and usability of JavaScript or Python while also having great performance with multiprocessing CPUs and networking.

The Go community says that Go was born out of the need for efficiency, safety, and ease of programming.

The language [syntax](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/syntax) is part of the C-family[1].

It also has a cool mascot, the Gopher!
