# Data Types

---
## Content

**Go** support several data types. These are categorized into four groups:
- basic
- aggregate
- reference
- interface

For now, we will only discuss the basic types.

## Basic data types

- numbers
- strings
- booleans

The numbers category contains several data types corresponding to different types and sizes.

Integers:

Strings are a sequence of characters **enclosed by quotation marks** `"lik3 th1s"`. The characters can be anything.

Booleans are the smallest type. They can only take `true` or `false` as a value.
