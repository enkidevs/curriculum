# Collections vs arrays

---
## Content

Collections are more feature-rich than arrays so are preferable in most cases. for example: 

- Arrays are fixed size, while collections are dynamic.
- The immutability of a collection can easily be controlled, e.g. using Java's immutable collections.
- References to collections can be generic, allowing implementation to be easily changed.
- Collections have pre-made sorting algorithms.
