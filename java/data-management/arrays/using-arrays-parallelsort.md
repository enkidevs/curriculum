# Using `Arrays.parallelSort` 

---
## Content

Amongst the new Java8 features includes new methods in the `java.util.Arrays` class.

Basic syntax for sorting into ascending numerical order:
```java
Arrays.parallelSort(myArray);
``` 

To sort a range:
```java
Arrays.parallelSort(myArray, int fromIndex,
 int toIndex);
```
`parallelSort` uses the Fork/Join framework introduced in Java 7 to assign the sorting tasks to multiple threads available in the thread pool.

It implements a parallel sort-merge algorithm that recursively breaks the array into 4 pieces, sorts them and merges them.


In comparison with the previous `sort()` method, `parallelSort` efficiency increases directly proportional with the number of elements in the array. 

```java
      Elements  | Serial | Parallel
          602   |  0.001 |  0.004        
         2492   |  0.007 |  0.007        
       318976   |  0.419 |  0.152        
      5103616   |  1.578 |  0.686   
```

For small arrays (up to around 2000 elements) `sort()` remains the best choice.

## Practice

Sort the given array in parallel from indexes `6` to `100`:
```
???.???(
      myArray, 6, 100
     );
```

* `Arrays` 
* `parallelSort` 
* `Array` 
* `sort()` 
* `Sorting`

## Revision

When sorting a small array (up to `2000` elements), what methods is considered more efficient?

`???`


* `sort()` 
* `parallelSort()`
