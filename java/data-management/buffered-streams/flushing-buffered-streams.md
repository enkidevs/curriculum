# Flushing buffered streams

---
## Content

Buffered streams typically only call the native output API once the buffer is full. Sometimes it is appropriate to write from a buffer before it is full; this is called *flushing*.

This can be done by calling the `flush` method which is included in all output stream classes:
```
outStream.flush();
```
However, it is not always necessary to manually flush a buffer. For example, the `close` method automatically flushes the buffer before closing the stream.
