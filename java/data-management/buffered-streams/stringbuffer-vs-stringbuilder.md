# `StringBuffer` vs `StringBuilder`

---
## Content

While both the clases can be used to concatenate strings, the key differences between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` are:

* The `StringBuilder` class has *no guarantee of synchronization*, but provides an API compatible with `StringBuffer`. 

* `StringBuilder` is a drop-in replacement for `StringBuffer` for *use in a single thread* with no synchronization. 

Performance wise, `StringBuilder` is faster compared to `StringBuffer`, and hence should preferred under most implementations.
