# Using buffered streams

---
## Content

Using unbuffered I/O like `FileReader` can be inefficient because the read requests are handled directly by the operating system.

Using buffered streams can make a program more efficient. Data is written to or read from a buffer, and the native API is only called when the buffer is full. This reduces the number of necessary expensive operations like disk access or network activity.

A buffered stream can be created by passing an unbuffered stream object to a buffered stream constructor. For example:
```
input = new BufferedReader(
  new FileReader("in.txt")
);
output = new BufferedWriter(
  new FileWriter("out.txt")
);
```

## Revision

Why is it more efficient to write to a file using a buffer?

???

* The buffer reduces the number of disk accesses required to write the data.
* The buffer increases the number of disk accesses required to write the data.
* The stream closes itself after it finished writing.
