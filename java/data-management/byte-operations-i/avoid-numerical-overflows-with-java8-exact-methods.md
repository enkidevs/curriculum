# Avoid numerical overflows with *Java8* `exact` methods.

---
## Content

To avoid *numerical overflows* or *underflows* (that is assigning a value to a variable whose type size does not allow it), a specific set of methods have been added with **Java 8**.


The `Math` class has been enhanced with the release of **Java 8**, adding a new set of `exact` methods.

Adding two numbers:
```java
Math.addExact(a,b);
```

Multiplying two numbers:
```java
Math.multiplyExact(a,b);
```
Incrementing a number:
```java
Math.incrementExact(a);
```
 If an *overflow* or *underflow* occurs, then the methods will throw an `ArithmeticException` exception:

```java
System.out.println(100000 * 100000);
//output : 1410065408 (Incorrect result)
System.out.println(
 Math.multiplyExact(100000 , 100000));
//output : ArithmeticException thrown
```

## Practice

What exception will be thrown when an overflow or an underflow occurs using **exact** methods of the `Math` class?

`???`


* `ArithmeticException` 
* `FileNotFoundException` 
* `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` 
* `ExactArithmeticException` 
* `OverflowlowException`

---
## Revision

What method can be used from the `Math` class such that numerical overflows and underflows are avoided during addition?

`???`


* `addExact` 
* `incrementExact` 
* `add` 
* `exactAdd`
