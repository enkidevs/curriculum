## Content

The java programming language provides operators that perform bitwise and bit shift operations on integral types. Using those substantially improves performance.

```java
a = 300 * 4 // standard multiplication
a = 300 << 2 // bit shifting

b = 300 / 4 // standard division
b = 300 >> 2 // bit shifting.
```
