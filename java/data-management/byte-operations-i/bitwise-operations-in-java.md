# Bitwise Operations in Java

---
## Content

*Java* provides us with certain bitwise operations, i.e., operations on real bits of the binary representation of the value. Such operations are:
 - `&` - *AND* operator returns `1` if both bits are `1`.
 - `|` - *inclusive OR* or *OR* operator returns `1` if both or at least one bit is `1`.
 - `^` - *exclusive OR* or *XOR* operator returns `1` if one but not both bits are `1`.
 - `~` - *unary bitwise complement operator* inverts bit pattern, i.e. swaps every `0` to `1` and every `1` to `0`.

This is very similar to how correlated logical operators work but on all bits throughout the length of the binary data:
```
public class Main{
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int a = 1; //0001 in binary
    int b = 5; //0101 in binary
    System.out.println(a & b);
    //&:   0001
    //     0101
    //

```

## Practice

What would be the output of `System.out.println(7 & 5);`, 7 = 0111, 5 = 0101?

???


* 5
* 0
* -5

## Revision

What does *AND* operation return if the input bits are `1` and `0`?

???

What does *OR* operation returns if the input bits are `1` and `0`?

???


* `0`
* `1`
