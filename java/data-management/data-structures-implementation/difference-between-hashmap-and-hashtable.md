# Difference between ```HashMap``` and ```Hashtable```

---
## Content

Both `HashMap` and `Hashtable` implement Map interface but there are some significant differences between them. 

`HashMap` class is non synchronized and permits null values as key and value, whereas `Hashtable` does not allow nulls.

`Hashtable` is also **synchronized** which means it is thread-safe and `Hashtable` instances can be accessed by multiple threads.
