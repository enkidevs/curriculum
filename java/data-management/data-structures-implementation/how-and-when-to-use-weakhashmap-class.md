# How and when to use `WeakHashMap` class

---
## Content

A `WeakHashMap` is a special `Map` implementation where the keys of the map are stored in a `WeakReference`.

The `WeakHashMap` functions identically to the `HashMap` with one important exception: if the Java memory manager no longer has a strong reference to the object specified as a key, then the entry in the map will be removed.

Creating a `WeakHashMap`:
```java
HashMap map = new WeakHashMap();
```

You can use `WeakHashMap` to save resource by keeping a reference to something but allow it to be collected by the garbage collector when nothing else references it.

You can test this with a forced garbage collection : 
```java
System.gc();
```

It is widely regarded that caching problems can easily be solved with `WeakHashMaps`, since when the references become obsolete they get discarded.

Another usage for this class is the creation of canonical maps, as you can store additional properties to certain objects as `WeakHashMaps` entries that will be immediately discarded when they become obsolete.

## Practice

When is a `WeakHashMap`  entry taken by the garbage collector? 

???

* When the key’s strong reference is set to be null.
* When it’s empty.
* After it has been used once.

## Revision

Complete the following Java code snippet to create a new weak hash map instance and to force a garbage collection:
```
HashMap map =
      new ???();
System.???();
```

* `WeakHashMap` 
* `gc` 
* `HashMap` 
* `garbage` 
* `mapInstance` 
* `collect` 
* `garbagecollect`
