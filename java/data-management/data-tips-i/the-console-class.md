# The `Console` class

---
## Content

The `Java.io.Console` class provides methods to access the character-based console device, if any, associated with the current *Java Virtual Machine*. This class is attached to the `System` console internally. 

`Console` class provide means to read text and passwords from the console.

To read a line as a `String`:
```java
Console console = System.console();
String myString = console.readLine();

```

To read a password as an array of `char`s:
```java
Console console = System.console();
char[] pw = console.readPassword();

```

If you read passwords using `Console` class, it will not be displayed to the user.

Keep in mind that this class does not have a high level of security and it is mostly used at development stage.
