# Translating `Scanner` tokens into primitive types

---
## Content

The `Scanner` class can be used to break an input into tokens separated by delimiters. `Scanner` also has methods to translate each token into one of Java's primitive types.

Delimiters are string *patterns* and are set in the following way:
```java
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
s.useDelimiter(pattern);
```

If we need to read a file containing a set of integers, and calculate the total, we can use `Scanner`'s `nextInt` method:
```
int sum = 0;
//create a new instance of Scanner
Scanner s = new Scanner(
  new BufferedReader(
    new FileReader("in.txt")));
/*tokenize the input file and 
convert to integers*/
while (s.hasNext()) {
  if (s.hasNextInt()) {
    sum += s.nextInt();
  } else {
    s.next();
  }   
}
```
In the example above, we iterate through the file, tokenizing each value and converting it to an integer before adding it to `sum`.

## Practice

What will the value of `sum` be for the given input?
```
3 5 test 6
```
???

* 14
* NumberFormatException
* 8test6
* 14test
* 8

---
## Revision

Which method of the *Scanner* class returns the next double value read?

???

* nextDouble()
* hasNextDouble()
* getDouble()
* parseDouble()
