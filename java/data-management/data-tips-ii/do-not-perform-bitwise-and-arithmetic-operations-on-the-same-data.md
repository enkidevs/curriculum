# Do not perform bitwise and arithmetic operations on the same data

---
## Content

Arithmetic operators are operated on numeric variables, whereas bitwise operators (`<<`, `>>`, `&`, etc.) are operated on bit collections exclusively.
 
Although performing both types of operations on the same data may compile, it often results in confusion and reduces code readability. 

Example of a non-compliant code:
```
int a = 7;
a += (a << 3) + 3; //left shift
//^ adding 8a + 3 to a 
//Intention: a = 9a + 3
```
A better implementation would be:
```
int a = 7;
a = 9 * a + 3;
```
Similarly a right shift operation might be used instead of division in a misguided attempt to optimize performance:
```
int a = -20;
a >>= 2;     // a = -5
```
But perhaps a better implementation is:
```
int a = -20;
a /= 4;     // a = -5
```

## Revision

What is the arithmetic equivalent of `a >> 3`  ?

???

* a/8
* a/4
* 8a
* 4a
* 3a
* a/3
