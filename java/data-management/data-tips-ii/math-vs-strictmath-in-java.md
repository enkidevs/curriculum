# `Math` vs `StrictMath` in java

---
## Content

Java offers 2 very similar classes - `java.lang.Math` and `java.lang.StrictMath`.  Unlike some of the numeric methods of class `StrictMath`, all implementations of the equivalent functions of class `Math` are not defined to return the bit-for-bit same results. This allows better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is not required.

Prefer using `StrictMath` if ensuring portability is essential for your code.

## Practice

If portability is intended what java class is more reliable?

`???`


* `StrictMath` 
* `Math`
