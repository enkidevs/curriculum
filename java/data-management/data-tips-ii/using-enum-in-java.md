# Using `enum` in Java

---
## Content

In Java `enum` is a type whose fields consist of a fixed set of constants. You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants, e.g. days of the week, cards in a deck or menu item options. 

```java
public enum Day {
  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
  Thursday, Friday, Saturday
}
```
Code above represents an example enum type that declares the day of the week in an enum named `Day`.
