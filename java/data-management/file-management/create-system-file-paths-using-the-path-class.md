# Create system file paths using the `Path` class

---
## Content

System file paths can be represented in Java by using the `Path` class. For example, a path can be created using the `Paths.get()` method:
```
Path p = Paths.get("/u/me/tmp/myfile.txt");
```
Here is an alternate form for specifying a path. `System.getProperty("user.home")` is used to find the local home directory.
```
Path p = Paths.get(
  System.getProperty("user.home"),
  "tmp", 
  "myfile.txt"
);
```
**Note**: This will not work in versions previous to Java 7.

## Practice

What does `Paths` helper class do?

???

* Converts a path String to a Path object.
* Converts a Path object to a path String.
* Returns a path String to the local folder.
* Returns only a Path object to the user's home folder.

## Revision

Which is the shorthand equivalent of the following command that returns a Path object from a String?
```java
FileSystems.getDefault()
           .getPath("/myDocs/diary.txt");

???
```

* `Paths.get("/myDocs/diary.txt");`
* `Paths.get(/myDocs/diary.txt);`
* `Path.get("/myDocs/diary.txt");`
* `Path.getPath("/myDocs/diary.txt");`
