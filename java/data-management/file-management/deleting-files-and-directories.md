# Deleting files and directories

---
## Content

JDK provides the static `delete` method to delete files and directories.
Basic syntax:
```java
File.delete(path);

```
If the deletion fails then an exception is thrown. There are several reasons that deletion might fail:
- The target could not be found; this will throw a `NoSuchFileException`.
- The target directory is not empty. It must be emptied beforehand. This will throw a `DirectoryNotEmptyException`.
- The program did not have the correct permissions to delete the file, this can be found by catching all `IOException`s.

Keep in mind that if the `file` is a symbolic link then the symbolic link itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted.

As to avoid `DirectoryNotEmptyException` you can use the `walkFileTree` static method to delete  all entries in the directory, or an entire file-tree where required.

## Revision

Use `File` class to delete a file:
```
File.???;
```

* `delete(path)` 
* `rm(path)` 
* `remove(path)` 
* `drop(path)`
