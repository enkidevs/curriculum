# List contents of a directory with `newDirectoryStream`

---
## Content

```
Path dir = Paths.get("home/dir");
DirectoryStream<Path> stream =
  Files.newDirectoryStream(dir);
```
The object that is returned implements the `Iterable` interface, which allows us to iterate over the contents of the directory:
```
for(Path file: stream) {
  System.out.println(file.getFileName());
}
```

---
## Revision

Obtain a `DirectoryStream` collection:
```
Path dir = Paths.("path/dir");
???<Path> stream =
   ???
  .???;
```

* `DirectoryStream` 
* `Files` 
* `newDirectoryStream(dir)` 
* `newDirectoryStream()` 
* `File`
