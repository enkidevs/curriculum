# Control OS `Process`es in `Java8`

---
## Content

Launching an OS process from within your code can have unexpected results or result to bad exceptions down the line.
 The problem with launching a process from within Java code so far has been the difficulty to control a process once it has been launched.

**Java8** introduced three new methods in the `Process` class in order to help with that:
- `destroyForcibly()`
- `isAlive()`
- `waitFor()` overload

`destroyForcibly()` terminates a process with a much higher degree of success than before. As a use-case you can check if a `process` didn't finish on time, terminate it and move forward:

```java
if (process.wait(MY_TIMEOUT, 
 TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)){ /*success!*/ }
else { process.destroyForcibly(); }

```
`isAlive()` tells if a process launched by your code is still alive. You can make sure that before your code is done, you're not leaving any processes behind. 

```java
for (Process p : processes) {
 if (p.isAlive()) { 
p.destroyForcibly();}}
```

## Practice

What method from the `Process` class, introduced in Java8 should be used to terminate a process?

`???`


* `destroyForcibly` 
* `destroy` 
* `terminate` 
* `end` 
* `exit`

---
## Revision

In Java8  several methods have been added to the `???` class in order to make easier the management of OS processes.


* `Process` 
* `OS` 
* `ExternalProcess` 
* `Interaction`
