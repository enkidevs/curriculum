# How to check for static dependencies of applications and libraries from the command line.

---
## Content

Introduced with JDK 8, the `jdeps` command shows the package-level or class-level dependencies of Java class files (applications or libraries) from within the command line.

Basic syntax:

```java
$ jdeps myApplication.jar 

```

The input class can be a path name to a `.class` file, a directory, a `JAR` file, or it can be a fully qualified class name to analyze all class files. 

Prints all class-level dependencies:
```java
$ jdeps -v myApplication.jar
```

Write the output in `.dot` files :
```java
$ jdeps -v myApplication.jar 
-dotoutput LOCATION

```
There are a few more useful options available for use with `jdeps`. You can always check them by running`jdeps -help`.

## Practice

Print all class-level dependencies of `enki.jar` application:
```
??? ??? enki.jar
```

* `jdeps` 
* `-v` 
* `-c` 
* `-d` 
* `jdb` 
* `deps`
