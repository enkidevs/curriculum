# Java8's new `StampedLock`

---
## Content

`ReadWriteLock` interface was introduced because `synchronized` blocks would not grant the ability to have more than one thread in a critical situation, for example where multiple threads are trying to edit some data, and others to simply read it.
```java
ReadWriteLock lock = new
   ReentrantReadWriteLock();
```

These locks specify which threads block everyone else (writers) and which ones work with others for consuming content (readers), but they are known for their slowness.

**Java8** introduced a new type of locks, `StampedLock`. In contrast to `ReadWriteLock` the locking methods of a `StampedLock` return a stamp represented by a `long` value.

```java
StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();

```

Obtaining a read or write lock via `readLock()` or `writeLock()` returns a stamp which is later used for unlocking within the finally block or to check if the lock is still valid.

---
## Practice

The locking methods of a `StampedLock` return a stamp represented by a `???` value.


* `long`
* `int`
* `float`
* `char`
* `String`

---
## Revision

To stop any reading locks from being obtained, you can use the method:
```java
StampedLock lock =
             new StampedLock();
lock.???;
```


* `writeLock()`
* `readLock()`
* `lockReading()`
* `lockWriting()`
