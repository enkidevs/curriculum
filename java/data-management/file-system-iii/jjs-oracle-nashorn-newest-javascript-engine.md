# `JJS` - Oracle Nashorn, newest JavaScript Engine

---
## Content

With the introduction of *Java 8*, the *JDK* will be shipped with a new *JavaScript* scripting engine, a replacement for the old one based on *Mozilla Rhino*. 

 **Oracle Nashorn** provides better compliance with the *ECMA* normalised *JavaScript* specification and better runtime performance through *invokedynamic*-bound call sites.

The `jjs` tool can be run from the terminal and accepts *JavaScript* files as argument:
```shell
$ jjs MyFile.js
```

While **Oracle Nashorn** runs *ECMA*-compliant *JavaScript*, it is important to note that objects normally accessible in a web browser are not available, for example, `console`, `window`, and so on.

In order to get a list of all jjs commands:
```
$ jjs -help
```

A few interesting features of Oracle Nashorn:

- It can run scripts as JavaFX applications.
- JavaScript strict mode activation to run system scripts.
- Additional classpath elements can be specified for the JVM.
- The scripting mode mainly consists of heredocs and shell invocations.
