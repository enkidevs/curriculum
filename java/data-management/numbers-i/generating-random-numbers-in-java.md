# Generating random numbers

---
## Content

There are two ways to generate random numbers.
- The `Math.random` static method can be used to generate a random `double` between 0  (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

```
// x is a double between  0 (inclusive)
// and 1 (exclusive)
double x = Math.random();

```

- The `Random` class can be used to generate various types of numbers in different ranges.

```
// x is an integer between 5 
// and 10 (both inclusive)
int min = 5;
int max = 10;
Random rand = new Random();
int x = rand.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
```

`Math.random` is appropriate when a `double` is needed, however it is better to use the `Random` class to generate random `int` values.
