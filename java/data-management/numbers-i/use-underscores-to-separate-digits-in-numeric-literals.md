# Use underscores to separate digits in numeric literals

---
## Content

In JDK 7+, it is possible to place underscores '_' inside numeric literals in order to make them more readable.

One example use of this is to break a long series of digits such as a phone number into several sub-sections, by for example, separating the area code:
```
int phoneNumber = 1234567890;
int phoneNumber = 12345_67890;
```
This can also be used break very large integer values to make them more readable; using underscores instead of commas. So 1,000,000,000 would become:
```
int billion = 1_000_000_000;
```
Note that underscores must be placed in between digits; values that begin or end with an underscore are invalid.
