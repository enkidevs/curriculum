# Trigonometry using the `Math` class

---
## Content

The `Math` class contains various methods for performing trigonometric functions. For example, it is possible to convert a value in degrees to radians:
```
double degrees = 45;
double radians = Math.toRadians(degrees);
```
Then find the sine of this value:
```
System.out.format(
  "The sine of %.1f degrees is %.4f%n",
  degrees, 
  Math.sin(radians)
);

```
