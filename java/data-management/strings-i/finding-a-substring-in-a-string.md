# Finding a substring in a string

---
## Content

In order to confirm if a string contains a specific substring, we can simply use the `contains` method in the `String` class.

The `contains` method takes a `CharSequence` as an input. `CharSequence` is an interface which is implemented by `String`, so it will also accept strings as inputs. 
```
String s = "Hello, this is dog.";
bool dog = s.contains("dog");
//dog: true
```
If simply confirming that a substring is present is not enough, and we also need to find *where* it is in the string, we can use the `indexOf` or `lastIndexOf` methods:
```
String s = "This dog is my dog";
int indexFirst = s.indexOf("dog");
//indexFirst: 5
int indexLast = s.lastIndexOf("dog");
//indexLast: 15
```
