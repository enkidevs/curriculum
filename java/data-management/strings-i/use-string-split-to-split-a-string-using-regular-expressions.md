# Use `String.split()` to split a string using regular expressions

---
## Content

`split` takes a regular expression and splits the string around occurrences of this expression into an array of strings.
```
String s = "I ate 6 pancakes, 4
  digestives, 2 boxes of cherries, then
  I went to bed";
String[] sub1 = s.split(",");
String[] sub2 = s.split("\d");

```
In the example above, the original string will be split each time a `,` is encountered and stored in the array `sub1`. It will also be split each time a digit `(0-9)` is encountered and stored in `sub2`.

Splitting on `,`:
```
{ "I ate 6 pancakes",
  "4 digestives",
  "2 boxes of cherries",
  "then I went to bed"
}
```
Splitting on `\d`:
```
{ "I ate",
  "pancakes,",
  "digestives and",
  "boxes of cherries, then I went to bed"
}
```
Javaâ€™s split method ignores any trailing empty Strings.
