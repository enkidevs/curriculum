# Converting numbers to strings

---
## Content

One way to convert a number to a string is to create an empty string and append a number to the end of it:
```
int i = 5;
String s = "" + i;
```
A second method is to use the `String` class' `valueOf` method:
```
int i = 5;
String s = String.valueOf(i);
```
A third method is to use the `toString` method from one of the `Number` subclasses:
```
float f = 5.4;
String s = Float.toString(f);
```
