# Converting numbers to strings

---
## Content

One way to convert a number to a string is to create an empty string and append a number to the end of it:

```java
int i = 5;
String s = "" + i;
```

A second method is to use the `String` class' `valueOf` method:

```java
int i = 5;
String s = String.valueOf(i);
```

A third method is to use the `toString` method from one of the `Number` subclasses:

```java
float f = 5.4;
String s = Float.toString(f);
```
