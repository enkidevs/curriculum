# Avoid floating-point when calculating exact quantities such as money

---
## Content

Beware of `float` and `double` when attempting to calculate or represent exact quantities such as money. This is because of the risk of rounding errors.

Instead, use `BigDecimal` to represent these values. `BigDecimal` allows the programmer to specify rounding behaviour. If no rounding behaviour has been specified and an exact value cannot be calculated, a non-terminating decimal expansion `ArithmeticException` will be thrown. So special care should be given to catching and appropriately handling these exceptions, when e.g. division between two `BigDecimal` instances is performed.
