# CPUs count in a system

## Content

JDK from 1.4.x onwards allows us to use method `activeProcessorCount` in the `java.lang.Runtime` class. It returns the number of hardware processors currently available to the VM. It is typically used by large application to calculate the number of worker threads they should create.
