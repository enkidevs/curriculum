# Intro to `HPROF` 

---
## Content

`HPROF` is a tool shipped together with the *Java SDK*, a dynamically linked library that interfaces with the *JVM Tools Interface*.

The `HPROF` tool is capable of presenting CPU usage, heap allocation statistics, and monitor contention profiles. In addition, it can report complete heap dumps and states of all the monitors and threads in the Java virtual machine. In terms of diagnosing problems, `HPROF` is useful when analyzing performance, lock contention, memory leaks, and other issues.

Run with `HPROF` :
```java
$ java -agentlib:hprof MyClass
```

Obtain heap allocation profile:
```java
$ java -agentlib:hprof=heap=sites MyClass 
```
 

Collect *CPU* usage information (from the compiler) :
```java
$ javac -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples 
MyClass.java
```

The tool writes profiling information either to a file or to a socket in *ASCII* or *binary* format. This then can be further processed by a profiler front-end tool.

## Practice

Collect CPU usage information from the compiler using HPROF:
```
$ java -agentlib:???
    =cpu=??? example.java
```

* `hprof` 
* `samples` 
* `agent` 
* `alloc` 
* `heap` 
* `compiler` 
* `source`

## Revision

Using HPROF, obtain the heap allocation profile:
```
$ java ???:hprof=???
         =sites example
```

* `-agentlib` 
* `heap` 
* `alloc` 
* `allocation` 
* `-a-l` 
* `-hprof`
