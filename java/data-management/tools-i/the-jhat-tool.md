# The `jhat` tool

---
## Content

Memory leaks often happen due to objects kept alive because of some reference in the rootset, even though they're no longer needed.

 `jhat` is a tool that analyzes binary heap dump files by creating an `HTTP/HTML` server that can be surfed in a browser, giving an object-by-object view of the heap, frozen in time.  


Basic syntax:
```java
$ jhat example.hprof

```
`jhat` will analyze the heap dump and make the data available on a local webserver that it runs by default on port `7000` (*http://localhost:7000*). 

To allow `jhat` to use more memory:
```java
$ jhat -J-mx1024 example.hprof 
```

To change webserver port:
```java
$ jhat -port 8080 example.hprof 
```

More functions of this tool can be found via the `jhat -h` command.

## Practice

Change the webserver port:
```
$ jhat ??? 8080 enki.hprof
```

* `-port` 
* `port` 
* `-p` 
* `p`

## Revision

Allow jhat to use extra memory:
```
$ jhat ??? enki.hprof
```

* `-J-mx1024` 
* `-mx1024` 
* `-m1024`
