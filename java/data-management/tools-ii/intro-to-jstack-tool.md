# Intro to `jstack` tool

---
## Content

A stack trace of all threads can be useful in diagnosing a number of issues such as deadlocks or hangs.

`jstack` is a utility that returns a complete dump of the various threads running in an app, which you can then be used to pinpoint the problem from the command line.


`jstack` works the same as pressing Ctrl-Break within the console window in which a Java program is running, or calling `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` or `Thread.dumpStack()` on each of the Thread objects in the VM. 

Basic syntax:
```java
$ jstack PID
```

Print a detailed dump:
```java
$ jstack -l PID
```


A `jstack` call also dumps information about non-Java threads running within the VM, which aren't always available as `Thread` objects.

## Practice

`jstack` works the same as pressing Ctrl-break in the console window where a Java program is running, or by calling which two methods on each of the Thread objects in the VM? 

???


* `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` and `Thread.dumpStack()` 
* `Thread.getStackTraces()` and `Thread.getDumpStack()` 
* `Thread.stackTraces()` and `Thread.allDumpStack()`

---
## Revision

Print a detailed dump of threads in the app:
```
$ jstack ??? ???
```

* `-l` 
* `PID` 
* `-v` 
* `-d` 
* `dump` 
* `VM`
