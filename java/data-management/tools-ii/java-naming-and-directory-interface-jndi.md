# Java Naming and Directory Interface (*JNDI*)

---
## Content

*Java Naming and Directory Interface* is a Java **API** for a directory service that allows Java software clients to discover and look up data and objects via a name.  
 

The **API** provides:
- a mechanism to bind an object to a name
- a directory-lookup interface that allows general queries
- an event interface to check when modifications occur

In the simplest case, an initial `context` must be created using the specific implementation:
```java
Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, 
    "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.
       RefFSContextFactory");
Context ctx = new InitialContext(env);
```

A context is then used to look up previously bound names in that `context`:
```java
MyClass myClass = (MyClass)  
ctx.lookup("com.mydomain.MyClass");

```
*JNDI* can be used to perform read operations and operations for updating a namespace.
**JNDI** specifies a service provider interface that allows directory service implementations to be plugged into the framework.
