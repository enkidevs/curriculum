# The `jmap` tool

---
## Content

`jmap` - Memory Map: Prints shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given JVM process or a Java core file on the local machine. It can also used with the `jsadebugd` daemon to query a process or core file on a remote machine.

To print the heap configuration of a running Process:
```java
$ jmap -heap PID 

```

To print the heap histogram for a running Process:
```java
$ jmap -histo PID 

```

To list all loaded shared objects:
```java
$ jmap PID

```

You can also `dump` the heap information into a `.bin` file:

```java
$ jmap -dump:file=myFile.bin PID
```
If the `jmap PID` command does not respond because of a hung process, the `-F` option can be used (on Solaris OS and Linux only) to force the use of the Serviceability Agent.

## Practice

Dump the heap information into the `practice.bin` file:
```
$ jmap ???:???=
      practice.bin PID
```

* `-dump` 
* `file` 
* `dump` 
* `location` 
* `loc` 
* `dest` 
* `info`

## Revision

Print the heap histogram for a running process:
```
$ jmap ??? ???
```

* `-histo` 
* `PID` 
* `-h` 
* `-histogram` 
* `process` 
* `processID`
