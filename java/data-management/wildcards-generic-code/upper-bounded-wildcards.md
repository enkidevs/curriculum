# Upper bounded wildcards

---
## Content

Upper bounded wildcards can be used to make a variable less restrictive. For example, say we want to create a class which takes a `List` as a parameter. But we do not know whether the list will be `List<Number>`, `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>` or other subclasses of `Number`.

To solve this, we can use the wildcard `?` in place of a specific type. However, we do not want to accept *any* type; only ones that are subclasses of `Number`. To do this we can add an upper bound to the wildcard like this: `List<? extends Number>`:
```
public void method(
  List<? extends Number> list) {
  for (Number elem : list) {
    ...
  }
}
```
This method will now be able to accept lists of any type that is a subclass of `Number`.
