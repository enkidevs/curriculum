# Using lower bounded wildcards

---
## Content

Lower bounded wildcards can be used to make a variable less restrictive. For example, the following method will only accept collections of type `List<Integer>`:
```
public void method(List<Integer> list) {
  ...
}
```
Using a lower bounded wildcard `?`, we can modify the method to accept any `List` which contains `Integer` or any class which is a superclass of `Integer`:
```
public void method(
  List<? super Integer> list) {
  ...
}
```
This method will now accept `List`s of supertypes of `Integer`, such as `Number` and `Object`.
