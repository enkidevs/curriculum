# Using unbounded wildcards

---
## Content

Using unbounded wildcards can allow a method to accept a collection with any type. For example, `List<?>` used as a parameter means that the method can take a `List` containing any type as a parameter.
```
public void printList(List<?> list) {
  for(Object e : list) {
    System.out.println(e);
  }
}
```
The `printList` method can take a `List` containing any type as a parameter. This allows us to print the contents of any `List`.
