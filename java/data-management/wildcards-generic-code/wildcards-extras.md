## Content

Suppose we have class `A` and class `B` which `extends A`. Then consider:
```
B b = new B();                           

//this line works just fine     
A a = b;        
List<B> listOfB = new ArrayList<>();

//this line results in 
//compile-time error
List<A> listOfA = listOfB;
```
The point being that although `b` is a subtype of `a`, `List<B>` is not an subtype of `List<A>`. Instead they are both subtypes of `List<?>`.
```
List<? extends Integer> intList
                      = new ArrayList<>();
//This code will pass
List<?> wildList = intList;
List<? extends Object> objList = intList;
List<? extends Number>  numList = intList;
```

**NOTE:** `<?>` is the same as `<? extends Object>` as `Object` is the top class in *Java*.

## Revision

What is `<?>` equivalent to?

???

Suppose we have `class A` and `class B extends A`.
Considering the `B` is a subtype of `A`, is `List<B>` a subtype of `List<A>`?

???


* `<? extends Object>`
* No
* `<? super Object>`
* Yes
* In this case we can not tell
