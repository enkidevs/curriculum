# Wildcards vs Objects

---
## Content

`Set<?>` can be used to indicate the apparent type of "any" set. The `?` is a wildcard. This wildcard can match any type.

A `String` can be added to `Set<Object>` because `String` is an `Object`. However, `String` cannot be added to `Set<?>` due to the fact that the wildcard in `Set<?>` could indicate something that is not a `String`, for instance, `Set<Scanner>`.
