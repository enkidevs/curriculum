# Type Inference in Generic Methods

---
## Content

Type inference is a feature of generic methods which allows you to call them as if they were ordinary methods i.e. without specifying the type in between `<>`. For example:
```
public <E> boolean oneBiggerThanTwo(
  E one, E two) {              
  //in this case we will have to use
  //our own Util class, as 'compare'
  //method is not necessarily
  //specified for all type 'E'
  //parameters
  return Util.compare(one, two);
}
```
Then we can call it by:
```
boolean bool1 = <Integer>compare
                (Integer.valueOf(13),
                Integer.valueOf(37));
//or using type inference
boolean bool2 = compare
                (Integer.valueOf(13),
                Integer.valueOf(37));   
```
Type inference means that there is no need to specify type parameters when calling a function as compiler will do it for you.

What does type inference do?

???


* It allows you to omit specifying type parameters upon calling a method
* It allows you to call an abstract method if it has a 'default' return value
* It allows you to change then return type of a method depending on the input
