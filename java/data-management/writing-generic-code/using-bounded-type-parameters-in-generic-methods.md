# Using bounded type parameters in generic methods

---
## Content

Sometimes it may be appropriate to write a generic method, however it will not be possible for it to accept *every* type while still maintaining all the necessary functionality.

To solve this, use bounded type parameters to restrict generic methods from accepting arguments of a particular kind.
```
public <T extends Shape> 
  void drawAll(List<T> shapes){
    for (Shape s: shapes) {
        s.draw(this);
    }
}
```
The above method is used to draw a list of shapes. Writing a generic method with an unbounded type parameter would cause problems because lists of other types cannot be drawn in this way.

By specifying that `<T extends Shape>` we guarantee that only `Shape` objects can be passed to the method.

## Revision

Declare a generic method that only takes Lists of subclasses of `Dog` :
```
public <???> 
   ??? pet(List<???> dogs){
  for(each d : dogs){
     d.pet();
  }
}
```

* `T extends Dog` 
* `void` 
* `T` 
* `int` 
* `E` 
* `List<Dog>`
