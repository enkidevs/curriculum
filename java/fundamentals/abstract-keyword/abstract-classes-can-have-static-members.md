# `abstract` classes can have `static` members

---
## Content

An `abstract` class cannot be instantiated, so any instance methods that have been implemented cannot be called. 

However, it is possible to also declare `static` methods within an `abstract` class.  Because `static` methods belong to a class rather than an instance of that class, it is possible to call these `static` methods from an `abstract` class.

```
abstract class AClass {
  abstract void method1();
  static int staticMethod(int a) {
    return a * 2;
  }
}
```
The `abstract` class above contains a `static` method. It can be called like this:
```
int x = AClass.staticMethod(2);
```
An `abstract` class can also have `static` fields.
