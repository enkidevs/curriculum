# The `abstract` keyword

---
## Content

An `abstract` method is a method that is declared without an implementation.
```
abstract int calculate(int a);
```
Rather than being defined with braces `{}`, the method is left without an implementation.

A class which contains `abstract` methods must itself be declared as `abstract`. An `abstract` class cannot be instantiated, but it can be extended. Subclasses of an `abstract` class usually provide implementations of `abstract` methods. For example:
```
abstract class SuperClass {
  abstract int calculate(int a);
}
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
  public int calculate(int a) {
    return a * a;
  }
}
```
Here, `SubClass` extends `Superclass` and provides an implementation of the `abstract` method, `calculate`.

It is worth noting that methods in an interface are implicitly `abstract`, so it is not necessary to explicitly declare them as such.

## Practice

Which of the following is a properly declared abstract method? 
```java
abstract String optionX[String s]; 
abstract String optionY{String s);   
abstract String optionZ(String s);
```
???

* Option Z
* Option X
* Option Y

## Revision

Which of the following is a properly declared abstract method?
```java
abstract float optionA(float e);    
abstract float optionB(float e) {};
abstract float optionC(float e) {
  e++;
}
```
???

* Option A
* Option B
* Option C
