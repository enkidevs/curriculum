# Specifying an annotation retention policy

---
## Content

Meta-annotations are annotations which apply to other annotations. The `@Retention` meta-annotation specifies the way in which an annotation should be stored. There are three available retention policies:
- `RetentionPolicy.SOURCE`: the annotation is ignored by the compiler and maintained only at source code level.
- `RetentionPolicy.CLASS`: the annotation is retained by the compiler but ignored by the JVM. 
- `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`: the annotation is retained by the JVM and so is available at runtime.

For example:
```
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Introduction {
  String name();
  String date();
}
```
This annotation will be available at runtime.
