# Use Javadoc comments to describe the purpose of a class or method

---
## Content

A Javadoc comment starts with the opening tag ```/**``` and includes a description of a class or method, followed by additional info on what the method takes as parameter, the return type and more. 

For example:
```
/**
 * Returns the marks scored by a student.
 * @param  surname the student's surname
 * @param  id the student's nine-digit ID
 * @return the student's average marks
 */
public int getMarks(String surname, int id)
{
    // method body
    return marks;
}
```
The Javadoc is generated in HTML format from the source code and acts as reference for programmers. They are especially helpful when working on large projects.
