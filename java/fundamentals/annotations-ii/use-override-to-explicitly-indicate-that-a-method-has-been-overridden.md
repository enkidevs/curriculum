# Use `@Override` to explicitly indicate that a method has been overridden

---
## Content

It is possible to override methods in Java without explicitly declaring it, however it is good practice to indicate that this is a method redefinition by using `@Override`.

Using `@Override` allows the compiler to check that the method does actually override a method in the superclass. If the method does not override a method in the superclass, then the compiler will produce an error.
