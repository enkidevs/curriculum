# Using the `@Deprecated` annotation

---
## Content

The `@Deprecated` annotation can be used to indicate elements which should no longer be used. Any program that uses an element which is marked as `@Deprecated` will produce a compiler warning.
```
@Deprecated
public void oldMethod() {
  ...
}
public void newMethod() {
  ...
}
```
In this examples, `newMethod` replaces `oldMethod`. However we do not want to remove `oldMethod` completely because keeping it will help maintain backwards compatibility with older versions of the program.

We can keep `oldMethod()` and indicate to programmers that it should not be used in new versions by applying the `@Deprecated` annotation.

## Practice

Which of the two methods will raise a warning saying it is deprecated and should not be used?
```
public void one() {};
@Deprecated
public void two() {};
```

???


* `two()`
* `one()` 
* `none` 
* `both`

## Revision

Using a `@Deprecated` function will rise a ???.


* compiler warning
* compiler error
* run-time error
