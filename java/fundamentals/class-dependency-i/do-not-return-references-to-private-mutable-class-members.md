## Content

Returning references to `mutable private class` members allows for the opportunity to **corrupt** the internal state of a class *maliciously* or *accidentally*.


```java
class MutableClass {
  private Date d;

  public MutableClass() {
    d = new Date();
  }

  public Date getDate() {
    return d;
  }
}
```

`getDate()` returns the sole instance of the `Date` object, and so an untrusted caller may manipulate this `Date` object.

A safer alternative is to simulate the `clone()` behavior and create a new copy of the object to return:

```java
public Date getDate() {
  Date newD = new Date(d.getTime());
  return newD;
}

```

This returns a defensive copy of the `Date` object, which itself is *mutable*.

It means that the caller cannot manipulate the original private `Date` object.

## Practice

What is a *mutable object* ?

???
* An object that can be modified after instantiation.
* An object that cannot be modified after instantiation.
* An object with no fields.
* An object with no methods.

## Revision

Which of the following is a way of preventing mutable private fields from being modified outside the class?

???

* Getters should return a copy of the mutable field instead of the field itself.
* Getters should return the field itself.
* Avoid the use of setters.
