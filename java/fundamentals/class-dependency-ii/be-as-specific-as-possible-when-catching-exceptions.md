# Be as specific as possible when catching exceptions

---
## Content

When specifying the type of exception to catch, it is generally preferable to be as specific as possible. For example:
```
try {
  //open and read a file
}
catch (Exception e) {
  //do something
}
```
This code will catch any kind of exception that is thrown. However, this is not necessarily a good thing. This is because any exception, including ones that the catch block is not capable of handling, will be caught.

Instead, we can use more specific catch blocks:
```
try {
  //open and read a file
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
  //do something
}
```
In this case, the catch block only catches one type of exception. This allows us to create other catch blocks for different types of exception and specify behaviour for them individually.

## Revision

When handling exceptions, being more specific means:

???

* Catching a particular exception.
* Catching the generic exception.
* Having multiple `try` blocks.
