# Use a copy constructor for mutable objects

---
## Content

Rather than using `clone`, a simpler way to create a copy of an object is to use a copy constructor. For example, a class 'Person' with this constructor:

```
public Person(String name, int age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```
could have this copy constructor:
```
public Person(Person person) {
  this(person.getName(), person.getAge());
}
```
This would create another Person object with the same name and age properties. However, it is important to note that creating a copy is unnecessary for immutable objects, so using a copy constructor like this should only be done for objects whose state can be changed. For example, if the Person class had this method:
```
public void setName(String name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```
Then it is preferred to use a copy constructor.

## Practice

A copy constructor provides a simpler and safer way to create a copy of an object than using what method?

???


* clone()
* duplicate()
* construct()
* constructor()

## Revision

Which of the following code snippets is the correct copy constructor for the ‘Address’ constructor:

```
// Address Constructor  
public Location(String country,
                String city) {
  this.country = country;
  this.city = city;
}
// Option A
public Location(Location loc) {
  currentObj(loc.getCountry(),
             loc.getCity());
}
// Option B
public Location(Location loc) {
  this(loc.getCountry(),
       loc.getCity());
}
// Option C
public Location(Location loc) {
  now(loc.getCountry(),
      loc.getCity());
}
```
???


* Option B
* Option C
* Option A
