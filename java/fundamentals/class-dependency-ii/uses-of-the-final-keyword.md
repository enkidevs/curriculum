# Uses of the `final` keyword

---
## Content

The `final` keyword has different meanings depending on where it is used:
- If used on a class then it means that the class cannot be extended.
- If used on a method then it means that the method cannot be overriden.
- If used on a local variable, field or parameter then it means that the value cannot be changed after it has been set.

The advantages of using `final` are that:
- The programmer's intent is clearly communicated.
- The values of variables and fields cannot be accidentally changed.
- Allows the compiler and virtual machine to optimize your code.

## Practice

Which of the following is not an advantage of using the `final` keyword:

???


* It allows classes, where final has been used, to be extended to prevent code repetition.
* The values of final variables cannot be accidentally changed.
* The compiler and VM can optimize the code.

## Revision

Complete the following code snippet to forbid other classes to extend the `Example` class:

```java
public ??? ??? Example{
// Revision questions
}
```

* `final`
* `class`
* `static`
* `void`
* `String`

## Quiz 
### Can you predict the output of this inheritance example?

What would the following snippet output?

```java
class Tesla {
    public static final String MODEL = "Model S";
}

public class Roadster extends Tesla {
    public static final String MODEL = "Roadster";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Roadster.MODEL);
    }
}
```


 ???

* Roadster
* Model S
* error: MODEL is final
* Model SRoadster
