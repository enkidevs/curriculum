# Utility classes and `static` methods

---
## Content

Utility classes defines set of methods that perform common, often re-used functions. They do not depend on the state of any object, therefore should usually be declared as `static`.


```
public class Utility {
  private Utility() {
  }
  public static multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
  }
  ...
}
```
In the example above, the `multiply` method is `static` and therefore we don't need to create an instance of `Utility` in order to call it. 

In order to prevent a caller from instantiating `Utility` constructor is made private.
