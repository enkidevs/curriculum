# The distinction between overloading and overriding methods

---
## Content

In Java, methods can be both overloaded and overridden.
- Overloading refers to creating two or more methods with the same names but a different number or type of parameters. For example:

```
void addPerson(String name, int age){}
void addPerson(String name){} 

```
- Overriding refers to redefining a method that has been inherited from a superclass. The new method should have the same name, return type, as well as the same number and type of parameters. However definition of the method will be different. For example:

```
public class Parent{
  int method(int parameter){
    return parameter * 2;
  }
}
public class Child extends Parent{
  @Override 
  int method(int parameter){
    return parameter * 3;
  }
}

```
Note: it is good practice to explicitly declare overridden methods using `@Override`.
