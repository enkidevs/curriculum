# An interface's methods do not need to be declared as `public`

---
## Content

It is not necessary to declare an interface's methods as `public`. This is because every method defined within an interface is implicitly `public`.

As its name suggests, an interface defines a class' public interface; that is the set of methods which external callers can call to interact with that class or its instances.

`private` methods, by definition, are not part of a class' interface because they cannot be accessed by external callers. Therefore there would be no purpose in defining `private` methods within an interface.
