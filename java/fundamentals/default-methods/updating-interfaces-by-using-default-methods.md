# Updating interfaces by using `default` methods

---
## Content

Take the following interface:
```
public interface Cooking {
  public void fry();
  public void boil();
  public void chop();
}
```
To add new functionality, simply adding a new method to `Cooking` called `microwave()` will cause problems. Any class that previously implemented `Cooking` will now have to be updated in order to function again.

To avoid this, give `microwave()` a default implementation:
```
public interface Cooking {
  public void fry();
  public void boil();
  public void chop();
  default void microwave() {
    //some code implementing microwave
  }
}
```
As `microwave()` already has a `default` implementation defined in the `Cooking` interface definition, classes that implement it now don't need to implement `microwave()` in order to work.

This allows us to add functionality without breaking old code.

**Note**: This has been possible since *Java 8*.

## Practice

Add a new method to an interface without breaking classes implementing it:
```
public interface Move{
  public void byCar(){}
  public void byAirplane(){}
  ??? ??? byWalking(){
   // default implementation
  }
}
```

* `default`
* `void`
* `private`
* `static`
* `public`

## Revision

Which type of method declared in an interface requires some kind of implementation inside the said interface?

???

* Only default ones.
* None.
* All.
* Non-default methods.
