# Using inner classes

---
## Content

It is possible to nest a class within another class. A non-static nested class is called an inner class. Inner classes are defined the same way as other classes, but within the definition of an outer class:
```
class OuterClass {
    ...
    class InnerClass {
        ...
    }
}
```
An instance of an inner class can only exist within an instance of its outer class. An inner class has access to all of its outer class' fields and methods.

Advantages of using an inner class:
- *Increased encapsulation*: allows an outer class to declare its members private while still having them be accessible by an inner class.
- *Logical class grouping*: classes that are only used by one other class can be embedded within the class that uses them.
- *Increased readability*: it is easier to understand how an inner class is to be used since it appears within the class that will use it.
