# Using `static` fields

---
## Content

Marking a field as `static` indicates that it belongs to the class rather than instances of that class. This means that a `static` field will hold the same value for every instance that is created.

This could be useful for values that will stay the same for all objects of the same type; since it will prevent us from having to initialize the same value for each object.

Another use could be to keep count of something across all instances of a class. For example:
```
public class Countable {
  private static int count;
  public Countable() {
    count++;
  }
  ...
}
```
The `count` field is `static` so only one instance of it exists across all instances of `Countable`. Whenever a new instance is created, `count` is incremented by one. This means that `count` will store the number of instances that have been created.

## Practice

What does the following code snippet do? 
```
public class Enki {
  private static int x;
  public Enki() {
    x++;
  }
}
```
???

* Keeps count of something across all instances of a class.
* Keeps count of something in an instance of a class.

## Revision

Marking a field as static shows it belongs to the class rather than ??? of that class.

This means that a static field holds ??? for every instance created.


* instances
* the same value
* methods
* functions
* a different value
* a related value
