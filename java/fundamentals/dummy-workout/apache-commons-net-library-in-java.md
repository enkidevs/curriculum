# Apache Commons Net library in Java

---
## Content

`Apache Commons Net` library implements the client side of many basic Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions.

By using this library you can connect to FTP or POP3, send/receive files using NTP/SNTP and much more. There are plenty of working examples easy to adjust to everyone's need as well!
