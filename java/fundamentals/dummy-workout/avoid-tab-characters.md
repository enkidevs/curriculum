# Avoid tab characters

---
## Content

The use of tab characters for indentation purposes should be avoided because tab characters are ambiguous; they can be represented in different ways by different systems. This means that code that appears well formatted in one editor, may be difficult to read in another.

Instead, it is better to consistently follow a rule of multiple spaces for indentation; usually either 2 or 4.
