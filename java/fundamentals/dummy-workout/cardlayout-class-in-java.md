# `CardLayout` class in Java

---
## Content

A `CardLayout` object is a layout manager for a container. It treats each component in the container as a card. The elements of a `CardLayout` are stacked, one on top of the other like a deck of cards.

The card layout is very useful if you have various panels of widgets you need to display at different times, in or out of order. There are plenty of commands built into the `CardLayout` to facilitate the switching of the various panels on the fly.
