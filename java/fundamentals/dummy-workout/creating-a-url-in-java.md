# Creating a URL in Java

---
## Content

The easiest way to create a URL object is from a String that represents the human-readable form of the URL address. This is typically the form that another person will use for a URL. In your Java program, you can use a String containing this text to create a URL object:

```java
URL myURL = new URL("http://example.com/");
```
