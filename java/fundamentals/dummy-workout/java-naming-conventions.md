# Java naming conventions

---
## Content

There are several conventions that most Java developers follow when choosing names for things in their code. It is best to learn these conventions and follow them yourself to make your code more intelligible to other programmers.
- Class names should begin with a capital letter, e.g. `Customer`.
- Method names should begin with a lower-case letter, but all subsequent words in the method name should begin with a capital letter; this is called *camel case*. E.g. `getPhoneNumber`.
- Variable names should also be *camel case*.
- Constants should be all upper case delimited by an underscore, e.g. `MAX_HEIGHT`.
- Methods that retrieve a property of a class should begin with 'get', e.g. `getName`. (For methods that return a boolean, prefer 'is' to 'get', e.g. `isValid`).
- Methods which change a property of a class should begin with 'set'. For example: `setAddress`.

## Practice

Methods which change a classes property should start with ??? and methods which retrieve a classes property should begin with ???.

* set
* get
* retrieve
* change
