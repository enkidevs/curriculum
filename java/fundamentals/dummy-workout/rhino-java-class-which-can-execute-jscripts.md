# Rhino - Java class which can execute JScripts.

---
## Content

Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written in Java. While it has some limitations, like no access to objects or methods for manipulating HTML documents, it still can be very useful. 

Rhino converts JavaScript into classes. It works in both compiled as well as interpreted mode. It is intended to be used in server-side applications, hence there is no built-in support for the Web browser objects that are commonly associated with JavaScript.
