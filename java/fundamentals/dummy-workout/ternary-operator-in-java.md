# Ternary operator in Java

---
## Content

In a single line of code, the Java ternary operator allows us to assign a value to a variable based on a boolean expression. At its most basic, the ternary operator can be used as an alternative to the if/then/else syntax.

Sample code for determining max value between two integers is shown below

```java
maxVal = (x > y) ? x : y;
```
