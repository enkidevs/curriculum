# Using Inheritance to reduce code repetition

---
## Content

The properties and behaviour of one class can be *inherited* by another class. This allows us to limit code repetition, as repeated behaviour only needs to be defined in one class, and can then be inherited by others.

All animals have certain behaviour in common, for example, therefore we can define an `Animal` class which implements this common behaviour. 

Any further animal classes we write can then extend `Animal` and inherit the common behaviour.

```
public class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    //implement eat method
  }
  public void reproduce() {
    //implement reproduce method
  }
}
public class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    //implement bark method
  }
}
```
