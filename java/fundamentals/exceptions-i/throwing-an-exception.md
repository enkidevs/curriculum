# Throwing an `exception`

---
## Content

An `exception` is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
There are two types of `exception`:
- *Checked* : `exception`s checked at Compile stage.
- *Unchecked*: `exception`s that occur during runtime due to faulty logic. They are direct sub-classes of the `RuntimeException` class.

`Exception`s have to be handled and they can also be thrown. You can handle an `exception` inside a `try/catch` block :  
```java
try{
  //perform an action
} catch (IOException e){
  //consume the exception
}
```
To throw an exception:
```java
throw new Exception<>();
```

Methods can also throw an `exception`:
```java
public void myMethod() throws IOException {
}
```

An `exception` should be thrown when a fundamental assumption of the current code block is found to be false. 

For example, a methods that counts the number of elements from a `List` should `throw` an `exception` if the given parameter is not a `List`.
