# Throwing chained `exceptions`

---
## Content

It is sometimes useful to be able to throw an exception in response to an exception; this is called _chaining exceptions_.

A new chained exception can be created by using the following syntax:
```
try {
  //code which might throw an exception
}
catch(Exception e) {
  throw new Exception(
    "chained exception", //message
    e  //Throwable object
  ); 
}
```
The new `Exception` object takes two parameters; the first is a message to be displayed, and the second is the `Throwable` object which caused the exception.
