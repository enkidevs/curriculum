# Use descriptive error messages when catching exceptions

---
## Content

Using descriptive error messages can save a lot of debugging time. Avoid generic error messages like "unexpected error occurred" as these will not help you find the cause of the error. Describing *exactly* what went wrong will allow the programmer to get right to the problem.
```
Error: Invalid argument
```
This message tells us that an invalid argument was entered, but it doesn't tell us which argument or why it was invalid.
```
Invalid age: -5
```
This message is much more helpful. It tells us that the problem relates to the `age` property and that the value entered was `-5`. 

We now know where to look in our code for the problem, and have a good idea of why an exception was thrown.
