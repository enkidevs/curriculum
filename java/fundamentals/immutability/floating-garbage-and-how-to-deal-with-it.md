# Floating garbage and how to deal with it

---
## Content

Since garbage collector and application run concurrently on the machine during a major collection, objects that are traced by the garbage collector thread may subsequently become unreachable by the time collection finishes. Such unreachable objects are called floating garbage.

As a general rule, try increasing the size of the tenured generation by 20% to account for the floating garbage. Floating garbage in the heap at the end of one concurrent collection cycle is collected during the next cycle.
