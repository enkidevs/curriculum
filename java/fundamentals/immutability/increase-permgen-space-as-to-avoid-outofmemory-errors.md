# Increase `PermGen` space as to avoid `OutOfMemory` errors

---
## Content

Java Virtual Machines are allocated a default of `64 MB` of memory. Bigger applications will of course require more memory.

Permanent generation (`permGen`) is an area within the heap where class and method objects are stored. 

An app requires an increased `permGen` space when : 
- an application loads a large number of classes
- an application interns a large number of strings

When encountering the `OutOfMemoryError: permGen space` error, the permanent generation memory can be increased:
```java
$ java -XX:PermSize=256M
//increases initial PermGem space to 256 MB
```

A maximum `permGen` size can also be defined:
```java
$ java -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
//increases maximum PermGem space to 512 MB
```

Altogether with the `permGen space` error, `String.intern` or `ClassLoader.defineClass` errors can appear at the top of the error stack.

Bear in mind that with the introduction of `Java 8`, permanent generation space has been removed.

## Revision

Before Java 8, you couldâ€™ve increased `permGen` memory space to 256M with:
```
$ ???
```

* `java -XX:PermSize=256M` 
* `java PermSize=256M` 
* `PermSize=256M` 
* `java :PermSize=256M`
