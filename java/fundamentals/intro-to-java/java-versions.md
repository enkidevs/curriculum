# Java Versions

---
## Content

A little history for you. Java was first released in 1995. Since then, there have been 9 other major versions, Java 8 being the latest publicly available one. 

Even though there have been continuous improvements before *Java 5* as well, this version introduced a lot of new features and bug fixes that pushed Java to the top of the most used programming languages.

From a couple of hundred classes in *Java 1.0*, Java had grown to three thousand classes in *Java 5*. By *Java 8*, the number grew to be around 4300 classes.

Transitioning from one version to another has always left room for problems. Usually backporting (making new features available to older versions) was the most troublesome. Deprecated classes or optimizations made to the existing ones were also reasons for code to break.

One way to avoid this from happening is stopping public support for older versions, which has already happened. As of 2015, *Java 8* is the only publicly supported version.

Moreover, Java 9 is scheduled to be released at the end of July 2017.
