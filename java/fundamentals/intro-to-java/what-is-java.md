# What is Java?

---
## Content

**Java** is a programming language that follows the *Object-oriented programming paradigm* (also  known as OOP).

One of the particularities of the language that makes it so widely used is that compiled Java code runs on any machine that supports java, without recompilation. This principle is called *"write once, run anywhere"* (WORA). 

Java classes are compiled to `bytecode`, which any Java Virtual Machine (*JVM*) can understand.

The most recent major Java release is *Java SE 8*, or simply `Java 8`.

In short, Java is trying to be an object-oriented, secure, portable, threaded and dynamic language. We will discuss all these terms in future insights.

*Note*: You should get comfortable with the acronyms as they will come up regularly in the course of the workouts.
