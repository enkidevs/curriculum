# Why Should I Learn Java?

---
## Content

*Java* is one of the most used programming languages in the world, with millions of developers. It runs on PCs, mobile phones and even Blu-ray players. 

One of the reasons to learn Java is because the basic concepts are relatively *easy to understand*. And until you get confident enough, there is really no need to care too much for things like memory management or garbage collection, as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) takes care of them for you.

Java is also *static typed*. That means the code cannot be built before solving the errors, which saves time in the long run. Even though the stricter environment doesn't necessarily mean a better one, it allows beginners to stick to less overwhelming rules.

There are many more reasons you should learn Java. The only downside is, as with all other skills, that *it might take some time*.
