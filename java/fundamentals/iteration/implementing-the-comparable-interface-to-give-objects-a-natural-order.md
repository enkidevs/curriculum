# Implementing the `Comparable` interface to give objects a Natural Order

---
## Content

The `Comparable` interface imposes *natural ordering* on the objects of each class that implements it. It has one method, `compareTo`, which is referred to as its natural comparison method and also used to sort.

```java
public class MyClass 
  implements Comparable<MyClass> {
    protected int order;
    public MyClass(int order) {
      this.order = order;
    }

    public int compareTo(MyClass object) {
      return order - object.order;
    }
}
```

`compareTo` method should return:
- a negative number - when the current is smaller than the comparison object
- a positive number - when the current is greater than the comparison object
- zero - both objects are equal in terms of their natural order.

It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that 

`(x.compareTo(y) == 0) == (x.equals(y))`

Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
