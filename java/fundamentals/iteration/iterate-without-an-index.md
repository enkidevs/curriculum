# Iterate without an index

---
## Content

Using a for-each or an Iterator instead of a traditional for-loop is a more concise and less error-prone solution. 

Traditional for-loops use an explicit loop index, which can, for example, lead to off-by-one errors. 

For-each loops avoid this problem as they do not have an explicit index.


```
List<String> colors = Arrays.asList(
"red", "blue", "green");

//use
for(String color: colors){
  System.out.println(color);
}

//rather than
for(int i=0; i<colors.size(); i++){
  System.out.println(colors.get(i));
}

```
