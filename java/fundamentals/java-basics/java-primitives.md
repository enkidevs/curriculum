# Java Primitives

---
## Content

In Java, **primitives** are the most basic data types. To be able to use a variable, it must be declared first, like this:
```java
int myIntVariable = 3;
```
This tells the program that a field name `myIntVariable` exists, is of type `int` and has an intial value of `3`. As you might have guessed already, `int` is a primitive type.

By type of data held, some of the other existing primitives are:
 - Numerical
  - `long`: unlike `int` which can hold values up to 10 digits long, `long` values can be as long as 19 digits.
  - `float` and `double`, which both store floating point numbers.
 - Characters
  - `char`: stores Unicode characters (or numerical values associated with letters, signs or numbers)
 - Booleans
  - `boolean`: accepts `true` or `false` values.

When initialized, if they aren't given any values, each primitive type will default to:
```
int myInt; // default: 0
long myLong; // default: 0L
float myFloat; // default: 0.00f
double myDouble; // default: 0.00d
char myChar; // default: '\u0000'
boolean myBoolean; // default: false
```
For Java to make the distinction between values of different type, a suffix is needed: `L` for `long`, `f` for `float` and `d` for double. They should be declared as:
```
long myLong = 37512L;
double myDouble = 3.75d;
float myFloat = 3.75f;
// if none of the suffixes is
// specified, the values are seen as
// either int(for long) or
// double(for float)
```
