# Distinction between stack and heap memory

---
## Content

Stack and heap memory are both types of memory, but have different purposes and uses within a program:
- Stack memory is used to store local variables and method calls, while heap memory is used to store objects.

- Each thread has its own stack, and variables stored in a stack are only visible to that stack's owner. Heap memory is shared among all threads.

- A `java.lang.
StackOverFlowError` will be thrown if there is no available stack memory left. `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space` will be thrown if there is a lack of heap space.
