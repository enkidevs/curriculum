# Stop-the-world and Garbage Collection

---
## Content

`Java` features automatic memory management also known as *garbage collection* (GC). Once an instance of an object becomes unreachable from the executing program, it's classified as garbage and the memory it takes up should eventually be freed.

*Stop-the-world* (STW) means that the *JVM* is stopping the application from running to execute a *GC*.

When *GC* occurs every thread, except the ones used by it, will stop and will only resume after the *GC* task finishes.

You can enable *GC* logging before running an application:
```java
$ java -XX:+PrintGCDetails MyApplication
```

A common *GC* algorithm is **Mark Sweep Compact** (MSC) that HotSpot tend to use by default, being implemented with a *STW* approach.

**Concurrent Mark Sweep** (CMS) is an other *GC* algorithm. It does not use *STW* pauses.

You can enable *CMS* :

```java
$ java -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC MyApplication
```
It's designed to minimize *GC* pauses and thus keep the application responsive.

## Practice

Enable **GC** logging when running the java application:
```
$ java -XX:+??? 
              Enki
````

* `PrintGCDetails` 
* `GCLog` 
* `GCLogging` 
* `PrintGarbageCollection`

## Revision

What does **Stop-the-world** mean?

???


* `program is stopped so GC can execute` 
* `GC is stopped` 
* `program terminates` 
* `main thread is stopped`
