# Java Modifiers

---
## Content

**Modifiers** are keywords used during declaration that can change the variable/method/class behaviour.

In the previous insights, there were some words used that were not explained, such as:
```
public class ...{
//or
  public void start();
}
```

In Java, there are two main types of modifiers:
 - Access modifiers
 - Non-Access modifiers

### Access modifiers

Depending on the modifier, the variable, method or class is visible to:
 - the package (no modifier)
 - the class only (`private`)
 - every class (`public`)
 - the package and the subclasses (`protected`)

### Non-access modifiers

These modifiers describe other functionalities:
 - `static`: makes the declaration more general than instance specific
 - `final`: doesn't allow the variable, method, or class reference to change
 - `abstract`: makes JVM wait for subclasses to implement the methods/classes

We will talk about each of them in detail in a future workout.
