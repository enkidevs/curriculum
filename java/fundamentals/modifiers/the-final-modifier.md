# The `final` Modifier

---
## Content

The `final` modifiers limits the initializations number to *1*. A final variable cannot be reassigned to refer another object.

However, the data inside the object can be changed (also called its *state*).

For example:
```
public Car{
  private final int value = 10;
  private static final int PRICE = 30;

  public void changeValue(int x){
    value = x; // error
  }
}
```
N.B. `static` and `final` can be used together to create a constant, class specific variable. Their identifiers should also be all capital letters.

A `final` method cannot be overridden by any subclass. This is particularly useful when outsiders shouldn't modify the behavior of the class.

4. ETAD = DATE;
5. System.out.println(DATE);
```
