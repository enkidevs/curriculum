# Java Interfaces

---
## Content

As the name says, **interfaces** in Java are a way to present *objects* to the world.  

The difference between *interfaces* and *classes* is that, while a class has to provide *implementation* for all the methods inside, an interface can only *declare* a method and pass the task of defining the behavior to the **other classes** that implement that interface.

For example, this is a class:
```
public class Car{
  private String model;
  public void start(){
    System.out.println(model +
        " starts!");
}
```
This is an interface and a class implementing it:
```
public interface Car{
  public void start(){}
  public void stop(int speed){}
}

public class FamilyCar implements Car{
   private String model;
   public FamilyCar(String newModel){
     model = newModel
  }
  public void start(){
    System.out.println(model +" starts!");
  }
  public void stop(int speed){
    if(speed < 30){
      System.out.println(model +
          "stops gently!");
  }  
}
```
A common interface used in Java is the `List` one. Because a list is mostly conceptual and it can be *implemented* in many ways (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList` etc), it makes sense for it to be an interface.

We know **what** a list is supposed to do, and this is the type of data passed with an interface. **How** the list does it, depends on the list type: either using arrays or nodes.

An *interface* ensures the classes implementing it *provide* the methods for them to be considered `Cars`, but at the same time they are not restricted to **inherit** everything **extending** a `Car` class would mean.

Because an interface comes only with a model, a single class can implement as many interfaces as needed, unlike being able to extend a single class.
```
public class AmphibiousCar implements
                    Car, Boat{
  public void start(){
   ...
 }
}
```
Even though both `Car` and `Boat` interfaces would have the `start()` method, it wouldn't do anything anyway, so there is no problem in choosing the right one to use in each case. This is the advantage **interfaces** have over *super classes*.

## Practice

Which of the following lines of code is not valid?
```
1. public class FamilyCar extends Car{}
2. public class FamilyCar implements Car{}
3. public class AmphibiousCar implements
                           Car, Boat{}
4. public class AmphibiousCar extends Car,
                           Boat{}
```
???


* 4
* 1
* 2
* 3

## Revision

Complete the following snippet to make it runnable:
```
public ??? Car {
  public void start(){
    ???
  }
}

public class FamilyCar implements Car{
   ...
}
```

* `interface`
* `//nothing`
* `class`
* `System.out.println("The car starts!");
