# What Is a Class?

---
## Content

In Java, a **class** is a blueprint after which things with similar characteristics can be modeled. An example of a class is: 
```
public class Car {
  String model;
  String noPlate;
  String color;
  int noDoors;

  void start() {
    System.out.println("The car starts!");
  }
  void drive() {}
  void handBreak() {}
}
```
*Variables* declared *within* a class, but *outside* any method are called **instance variables**. They store a specific value for every copy of the blueprint and each copy has access to all the variables.

A **class** can have any number of variables or methods, and of any type. It is, however, considered best practice to add only relevant fields or functions. By convention, every class name should start with a *capital letter*.

### Constructor method

The matrix which transforms the blueprint into *something* is called a **constructor method**. Every class should have a constructor. If one is not defined, the Java compiler will initialize the variables to their default value.

A constructor method should look like this:
```
public class Car {

  // fields

  public Car(String newModel, String
     newNoPlate, String newColor,
                  int newNoDoors) {
     model = newModel;
     noPlate = newNoPlate;
     color = newColor;
     noDoors = newNoDoors;
  }
}

```
A *constructor* gives initial values to the *instance variables*, so the general blueprint can become an actual `Car` representation.

In other words, calling a constructor **initializes an object**.
