# What Is an Object?

---
## Content

An **object** is the representation of a blueprint. Basically, an *object* is created from a *class*. In Java, the `new` keyword is used to create an object. 

This is how the `Car` constructor looks like:
```
public Car(String newModel, String
     newNoPlate, String newColor,
                  int newNoDoors) {
     model = newModel;
     noPlate = newNoPlate;
     color = newColor;
     noDoors = newNoDoors;
}
```
And this is how you create a `Car` object:
```java
Car myCar = new Car("AwsomeCar",
            "RA-325F1", "red", 2);
```

There are three steps for creating a new object:
 - `Declaration`: a variable declaration with a type and a name.
 - `Instantiation`: the `new` keyword is used.
 - `Initialization`: constructor method is called.

To start a `Car`, you have to call the `start()` method. To start the `myCar` object, the method must be called on it:
```
myCar.start();
```
This ensures only `myCar` starts, and not the other `Car` object that exists in the program.

In case we want to check what model `myCar` is, we can access its fields like this:
```
System.out.println(myCar.model);

// AwsomeCar
```
