# Constant notation

---
## Content

When creating constants (variables with only one value), it's good practice to write them in full-capital letters.  

This is a common practice within the Java community and makes your code more understandable to other programmers.

```
public final int MYCONSTANT = 100;
public int myNumber = 50;
```

When including spaces in the names of your constants, use an underscore `_`:

```
public final int IMPORTANT_CONSTANT = 200;


```
