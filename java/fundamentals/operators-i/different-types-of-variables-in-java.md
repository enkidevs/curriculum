# Different types of variables in Java

Java supports three kinds of variables.  

Local variables are used inside blocks as counters or in methods as temporary variables and are used to store information needed by a single method.

Instance variables are defining attributes or states of a particular objects and are used to store information across multiple methods in the objects.

Class variables are global to a class and to all the instances of the class and can be used for communicating between different objects in the same class or keeping track of global states
