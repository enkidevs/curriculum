# Different types of variables in Java

---
## Content

Java supports three kinds of variables.  

Local variables are used inside blocks as counters or in methods as temporary variables and are used to store information needed by a single method.

Instance variables are defining attributes or states of a particular object and are used to store information across multiple methods in the objects.

Class variables are global to a class and all the instances of the class. They can be used for communicating between different objects in the same class or keeping track of global states.
