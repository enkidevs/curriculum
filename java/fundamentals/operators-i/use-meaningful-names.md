# Use meaningful names

---
## Content

When naming classes, methods, variables or just about anything that you are required to give a name to, it is best to choose names which have a relevant meaning.

This is to improve the readability of your code; a name which briefly explains the purpose or use of something will make it much easier for other programmers, or even the original programmer at a later date, to understand the code.

For example, this is not clear:
```
public String ga(String n) {
...
```
but this makes it obvious that this is a method which takes a name parameter and returns an address as a `String`.
```
public String getAddress(String name) {
...
```
