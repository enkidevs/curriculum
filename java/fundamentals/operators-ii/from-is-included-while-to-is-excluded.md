# 'From' is included while 'to' is excluded

---
## Content

As a convention, when specifying a range of values, the first value 'from' is included while the last value 'to' is excluded. 

For example in `String.substring(from, to)`, the character at position 'from' will be included in the substring, while the character 'to' will not. 

So, `"Enki".substring(1,3);` will return `"nk"`. The character at 1; 'n' was included and the character at 3; 'i' was excluded.

This convention also applies in other areas of the JDK such as `List.sublist(from, to)` and 
`Arrays.copyOfRange(T[], from, to)`.
