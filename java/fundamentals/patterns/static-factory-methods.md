# Static factory methods

---
## Content

Factory methods are static methods which return an instance of a class. Several advantages of this are:
- able to return a subtype of the return type.
- able to return an object with an implementation class that is unknown to the caller.
- do not necessarily need to create a new object each time they are called; objects can be cached and recycled.

```
public class Animal{
  //factory method
  public static Animal getInstance(){
    return new Animal();
  }
  //private constructor
  private Animal(){}
}
```
In the above example, the constructor is private to guarantee that instances of `Animal` can only be created using the `getInstance()` factory method.
