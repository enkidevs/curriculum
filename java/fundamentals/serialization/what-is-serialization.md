# What Is Serialization?

---
## Content

**Serialization** is a way to convert an object's state (i.e. the information about the object) to an array of bytes in *Java*. This information is of course retractable[1] and can be deserialized.

The motivation for using **serialization** might be the following points:
- Serialization is cross-platform i.e. it runs on a JVM and is independent of hardware configuration of the machine.  
- It is easy to store information about an object as a local file simply by serializing it.
- Different machines running same code can communicate via network by sending and receiving serialized objects.

In order to serialize an object you will use tools/classes available in the `java.io` library so it is important to remember to import `import java.io.*` library.

[1:retractable]
In this context this means that the information about this class can be restored back.
