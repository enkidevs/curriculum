# Avoid excessively long comments

---
## Content

It is often necessary to explain what a piece of code does by writing a comment; this can help make your code easier to understand. However, excessive use of comments can in-fact make code harder to read because there are more things in the way; obfuscating the code that is doing the actual work.

If you find yourself regularly having to write long explanations for the code you write, it may be a sign that your code is poorly written.

Following code formatting and variable naming conventions, i.e., writing *self-documenting* code can reduce the number of comments required.
