# Avoid synonyms when naming

---
## Content

When choosing names for methods or variables, it is best to be consistent and avoid using synonyms to describe different methods or variables which have the same purpose.

For example, if you have two different classes, one with a method `finish()` and another with the method `end()`, it would be better to be consistent and choose either 'end' or 'finish' to describe methods which serve this purpose. 

Using consistent names makes your code more readable and thus easier to maintain.
