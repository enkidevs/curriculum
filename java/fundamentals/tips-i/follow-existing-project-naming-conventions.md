# Follow existing project naming conventions

---
## Content

When working on a project with other programmers, or updating an old project, either one of your own or someone else's, it is best to follow the existing naming conventions in that project. 

Even if you think the naming convention you normally use is better, or the existing naming convention is archaic or unusual, you should follow the naming convention that is already in place; unless you want to go through the entire code renaming everything to suit your preferences.

A consistent naming convention will guarantee that the project is intelligible and easy to maintain. An inconsistent naming convention will inevitably cause confusion.
