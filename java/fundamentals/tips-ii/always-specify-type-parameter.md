# Always specify type parameter

## Content

A *parameterized type* would look like:
```
List<String> oceans = Arrays.asList(
   "Pacific", "Atlantic", "Indian");
```
Whereas, a *raw type* would look like:
```
List oceans = Arrays.asList(
   "Pacific", "Atlantic", "Indian");
```
Although Java allows the use of raw types, they should be avoided since:
* Using a parameterized type allows compile time checks - less chances of errors.
* Raw types usually require casts to convert to a suitable type.
* They only exist to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of Java.
