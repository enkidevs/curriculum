# Supply `toString()` in all classes

---
## Content

*Java* `toString()` method is inherited by any object, both user defined or provided by the JDK.

By default, it will return the `class` name followed by the `@` character and the hexadecimal value of it's `hashCode`.

`@Override` this method in order to provide any relevant debugging or printing information:
```java
//user defined MyObject
 @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "This is useful" ;
    }

```

The *PrintStream* method `println()` will invoke the `toString()` method, directly printing the relevant information.

```java
System.out.println(new MyObject());
```
Insert print statements to view the object state during the program run. Some debuggers can even invoke the `toString()` method on objects that you inspect.
