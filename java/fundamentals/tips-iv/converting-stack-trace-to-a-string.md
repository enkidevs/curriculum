# Converting stack trace to a string

---
## Content

To store stack trace as a string, you can use `Throwable.printStackTrace(...)`  
For example:

```java
public static String getStackTrace(
  Throwable throwable
){
  Writer result = new StringWriter();
  PrintWriter printWriter = 
    new PrintWriter(result);
  throwable.printStackTrace(printWriter);
  return result.toString();
}
```

In the above example, `getStackTrace` takes a `Throwable` as a parameter and uses `printStackTrace` to print it to a `PrintWriter` output stream. This output is collected by the `StringWriter` and converted to a string using `StringWriter.toString()`.
