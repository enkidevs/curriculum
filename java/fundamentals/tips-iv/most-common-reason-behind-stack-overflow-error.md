# Most common reason behind **stack overflow** error

---
## Content

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an implementation of a stack engine. When it compiles a java file, JVM goes through each line of code and pushes (stack equivalent of adding) each variable and method call. 

The `StackOverflowError` explicitly states what is happening with the stack: it has to keep pushing data, even though it reached its memory limit.

 
A common reason behind this is a faulty recursion algorithm (the function calls itself to infinity) and can be solved by adding a terminating condition or changing the old one.

If a program requires an extended stack (not because of a flaw in the logic), you can use the following command to change the default stack size:
```java
$ java -Xss:512k MyApplication
//increases stack to 512Kb

```

Default stack sizes of java threads differ depending upon whether you are using IA32 and X64 from `64` to `512 KB`.


For JVM internal threads (i.e. GC, code generation thread) a special "system" stack of size `256 KB` is used.
