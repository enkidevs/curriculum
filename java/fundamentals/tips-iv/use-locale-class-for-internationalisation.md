# Use `Locale` class for Internationalisation

---
## Content

The `Locale` class can be used to represent different regions, languages and scripts. We can use `Locale` to format output which is locale-sensitive. 

For example, in France, a comma is used in place of a decimal point in floating-point numbers. `Locale` can be used to achieve this in the following way:
```
System.out.format(
  "%f", 3.14
);
//output: 3.14

System.out.format(
  Locale.FRANCE, "%f", 3.14
);
//output: 3,14
```
