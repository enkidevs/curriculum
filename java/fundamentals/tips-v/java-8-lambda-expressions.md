# Java 8 Lambda expressions

---
## Content

The latest Java release included quite a few changes that pushed the language to be more functional-friendly.

Lambda expressions are one of the most significant additions that enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces more compactly.

Example of a lambda:
```java
class LambdaTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
     // Anonymous Runnable
 Runnable r1 = new Runnable(){
   public void run(){
     System.out.println("test1");
   }
 };
     // Lambda Runnable
 Runnable r2=
        ()->System.out.println("test2");
 r1.run(); // test1
 r2.run(); // test2
}
```

A lambda expression consists of the following:
- A comma-separated list of formal parameters enclosed in parentheses.
- The arrow token ->
- A body, which consists of a single expression or a statement block.

## Practice

Create a runnable with the help of lambda expressions:
```
Runnable myRunnable = ??? ??? 
   System.out.println(“my runnable”);
```

* `()` 
* `->` 
* `<-` 
* `=>` 
* `{}`

## Revision

What token is specific to Lambda expressions?

`???`


* `->` 
* `<-`
