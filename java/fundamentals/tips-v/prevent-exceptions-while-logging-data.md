# Prevent `exceptions` while logging Data

---
## Content

Successful logging can be *prevented* by exceptions thrown while logging is in progress!

This allows potential attackers to *conceal* *security vulnerabilities* by preventing them from being logged.

```java
try {
  // ...
} catch (SecurityException se) {
  System.err.println(se);
  // Recover from exception
}
```

This is erroneous, as **firstly**, the error stream can be *closed*, preventing any more exceptions from being *recorded*. 
**Secondly**, while writing the `SecurityException`, an `I/O Exception` could be thrown, overwriting the previous `SecurityException`.

Better practice is to use the `java.util.logging.Logger` API to record Exceptions:

```java

try {
  // ...
} catch(SecurityException se) {
  logger.log(Level.SEVERE, se);
  // Recover from exception
}
```

Only one logger is required for the entire program.
