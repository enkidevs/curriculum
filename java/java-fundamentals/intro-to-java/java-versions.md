# Java Virtual Machine


---

## Content

We mentioned that once you create your Java application, you can run it on any system. This is thanks to the Java Virtual Machine.

First, let's take a look at how your computer processes information. Because it is an electronic device, the language that it speaks is electricity. Information is received in binary numbers (that is `0` and `1`).

Using a sequence of 8 binary numbers, we can create text. For example, the letter `A` is `01000001`.

Okay so what does this have to do with Java? The process is the following:

1. Your Java code is compiled to binary numbers.
2. The new intermediary code is fed to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
3. The JVM then proceeds to identify your operating system and convert the intermediary code to native code

The ??? converts binary code to native code.

- Java Virtual Machine
- Java Virtual System
- Virtual Java Environment

## Revision

Choose the correct order for converting Java code to native code:

```plain-text
1. ???
2. ???
3. ???
```

- Java code is compiled to binary numbers.
- The binary code is fed to the JVM.
- The intermediary code is converted to native code.
