# What is Java?


---

## Content

**Java** is a programming language that follows the *Object-oriented programming paradigm*[1] (also known as OOP).

It was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, and has since grown to be one of the most used programming languages.

The fact that it's still one of the most-used languages over 25 years later shows how durable it is.

Java is a **secure[2], and portable language[3]**. We'll discuss what this means very soon!

## Footnotes

[1:Object-oriented programming]
All you need to know for now is that **object-oriented programming** (OOP) is a *programming paradigm* that works with real-life entities. These entities are called **objects**, and they have *attributes* and *behaviors*. 

Let's use the common car analogy to better understand OOP. 

Think of the car as the object. The model, color or age of the car are the object's *attributes*. Whether the engine is on, or whether it's moving are *behaviors* and would exist as methods.

[2:Secure]
In Java, some security flaws (stack corruption, buffer overflow) are impossible to exploit. Moreover, the style of coding reduces the chances to introduce a security flaw. 

[3:Portable]
Once you compile your Java code, it can run on any machine. This concept is called **WORA** (write once, run anywhere) and will be explained in the following insights.
