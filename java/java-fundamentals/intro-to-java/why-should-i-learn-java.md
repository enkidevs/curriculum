# Why Learn Java?


---

## Content

Here are several reasons to learn Java:

1. It's one of the most used programming languages in the world (with millions of developers).

2. The **basic concepts are relatively easy to understand**.

3. It's **statically typed**, meaning that **the code can't be built before solving the errors**. Even though the stricter environment doesn't necessarily mean a better one, it allows developers to catch bugs early on.

4. Once you create your program, you can run it on any machine. This principle is called **"write once, run anywhere"**(WORA). We'll explain this in the next insight.

5. It has continued support, with the roadmap being available publicly.

There are many more reasons you should learn Java. The only downside is, as with all other skills, that *it might take some time*.
