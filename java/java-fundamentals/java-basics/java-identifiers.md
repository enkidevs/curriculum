# Java Identifiers


---

## Content

In Java, every class, method, or variable has to have a name. Formally, this name is called an **identifier**.

An identifier is a sequence of one or more characters. Because the name given to new fields must not interfere with internal structures, there are some rules it has to follow:

- All identifiers must **start** with either a letter, capital or lower-case, a dollar sign (`$`) or an underscore (`_`).
- The rest of the characters can be letters, currency symbols, underscore, digits, numerals and combining marks. *Whitespaces* are not allowed.
- The identifiers must not be a *reserved word* (such as `while`, `if`, `break`).

Java is case sensitive, so `myident` and `myIdent` are two different identifiers.
