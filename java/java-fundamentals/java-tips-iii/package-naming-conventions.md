# Package naming conventions


---

## Content

To prevent name conflicts between packages, it is best to follow the naming convention for Java packages.

The internet domain name of the person or company responsible for the package is used in reverse preceding the package name.

For example, if we have a package called `examplepackage` and we work at a company with the domain name of `www.examplecompany.com`, the package name will be:

```java
package com.examplecompany.examplepackage;
```

In addition, package names are always in lower case.
