# Difference between JRE and JDK?


---

## Content

`JRE`: *Java Runtime Environment*. It is the Java Virtual Machine where your Java programs run on. It also includes browser plugins for Applet execution. 

`JDK`: It is the full-featured *Java Software Development Kit*, including `JRE`, and the compilers and tools (like JavaDoc, and Java Debugger) to create and compile programs.

If you only care about running Java programs on your browser or computer, you will only install JRE.

On the other hand, if you are planning to do some Java programming, you will also need JDK.
