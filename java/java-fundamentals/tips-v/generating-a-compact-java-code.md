# Generating a compact Java code

## Content

If you're trying to make your code more compact the obvious step would be to JAR all the files. There is however a way to make JAR files even smaller. Most of the modern code obfuscators are replacing long class/method, variables names 
(for example: CalculatingNumberOfThreads) by shorter, just 2-3 characters.

Use it only on final step, before delivery to customer, as it makes code less readable.
