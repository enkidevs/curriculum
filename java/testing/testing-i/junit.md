# Intro to JUnit

## Content

**JUnit** is one of the main *unit testing frameworks* written for Java. Testing means verifying that the application as a whole or small parts of it (*units*) behave as expected.

So, testing with *JUnit* means checking small snippets of code through **assertions**. They are used to make sure that the logic behind a piece of code is not flawed. A single test is called a *test case*. However, as E. W. Dijkstra once said, *testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs*.

Unit testing comprises:
 - *manual testing*: running each test case by hand
 - *automated testing*: using tools that bundle tests into test suites and running them all at once

One of the most common project structures when including tests (assuming a Maven bundle) is:
```
proj/src/main/java/com/users/User.java
proj/src/test/java/com/users/UserTest.java
```
The main reason for this structure is so you can access package-scoped classes. Another tip would be to append the `Test` suffix to the test name.

Consider this example of the `User` file:
```java
package com.enki.users;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.Period;

public class User {
  private String name;
  private LocalDate dob;
  ....
  public int getAge(LocalDate currentDate){
    return Period.between(dob, currentDate)
      .getYears();
  }
}
```
To write a basic test for the `getAge()` method:
```java
package com.enki.users;

import org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class UserTest {
  private User mike;

  @BeforeEach
  public void setup() {
    mike = new User("Mike",
      LocalDate.of(1985, 6, 15));
  }

  @Test
  public void testGetAge_Success() {
    int expected = 31;
    int refDate = LocalDate.of(2017, 1, 1);
    assertEquals("Age as of 1/1/2017:",
      mike.getAge(refDate), expected);
  }
}
```
To run the test, you have to create another class that will act as the **runner**:
```java
package com.enki.users;

import org.junit.runner.JUnitCore;
import org.junit.runner.Result;
import org.junit.runner.notification
                                .Failure;

public class TestRunner {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Result result = JUnitCore
      .runClasses(UserTest.class);

    for(Failure fail :
      result.getFailures()) {
      System.out.println(fail.toString());
    }

    System.out.println(
      result.wasSuccessful());
   }
}  
```
You can then run the tests from the command line:
```bash
$ javac UserTest.java TestRunner.java
$ java TestRunner
```

## Practice

In JUnit, code is tested with ???


* assertions
* equal statements
* deep equal statements
* `JUnit.testln()` statements

---
## Revision

Setting up a test runner is seen as a type of ??? testing.


* automated
* manual
* unit
* application
