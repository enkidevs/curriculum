# Preparing tests through annotations

---
## Content

As you may have noticed in previous insights, we've used the `@BeforeEach` annotation for describing a `setup()` function. In *JUnit 5*, `@BeforeEach` and `@BeforeAll` (and their equivalent `@AfterEach` and `@AfterAll`) annotations[1] are used to describe functions to be run at the beginning (and at the end) of `@Test` methods.


`@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` methods are executed for every test. This is the initial example:
```java
public class UserTest {
  private User mike;

  @BeforeEach
  public void setup() {
    mike = new User("Mike",
      LocalDate.of(1985, 6, 15));
  }
}
```
In this case, for the tests to follow, `mike` will be reinitialized as a user with the name of `Mike`, born on *15th June 1985*. In other cases, `@AfterEach` annotation can be used to close a file reading stream that was open in the beginning.

If there are multiple methods marked with `@BeforeEach` or `@AfterEach` their order of execution is arbitrary.

For more resource intensive activities (opening and closing a database connection), it is recommended to use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` annotations, hence executing the methods only once.

## Practice

In case you need a _custom set up_ function for a _single test_ in a set, you should

???


* define and call it as a normal method
* annotate it with `@BeforeAll`
* annotate it with `@BeforeEach`
* write a new test

---
## Revision

In JUnit 5, what method will be called only once, before all tests are done?

???


* `@BeforeAll`
* `@BeforeClass`
* `@AfterAll`
* `@AfterClass`
* `@Test`
