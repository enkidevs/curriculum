# `@Test` parameters

---
## Content

The JUnit `@Test` annotation is used to indicate that a method should be called to run a test. `@Test` can contain two types of parameter:

**Exceptions**

When the test is expected to throw an exception, we can indicate this by adding `expected = <exception>.class` after `@Test`, where <exception> is the name of the expected exception.

```
//fail if IOException is not thrown
@Test(expected = IOException.class)
```
**Time-out**

When a test needs to complete within a specific time period, we can add a parameter to `@Test` to fail if the test takes too long. The value in the parameter is measured in milliseconds.
```
//timeout after 500ms
@Test(timeout = 500)
```

---
## Practice

Complete the snippet such that the test expects an `IOException`  and has a timeout of `900ms` :

```
@???(
  ??? = IOException.class,
  ??? = 900);
```


* `Test`
* `expected`
* `timeout`
* `error`
* `TestCase`
* `expects`
* `time`
