# Writing JUnit tests using `Assert`

---
## Content

Making assertions allows us to check that our methods produce the correct outputs and that objects are in the states we expect them to be at run time.

The `Assert` class contains many methods allowing us to assert different things. For example, we can assert that two arrays are equal:
```
String[] arrayA = {"a", "b", "c"};
String[] arrayB = {"a", "b", "c"};
assertArrayEquals(arrayA, arrayB);
```
This assertion will pass because `arrayA` and `arrayB` are equal. In JUnit, if one assertion in a test fails, then that test method counts as having failed.
```
private boolean isEven(int number) {
  if(number % 2 == 0) return true;
  else return false;
}
@Test
public void exampleTest() {
  assertTrue(isEven(3));
  ...
}
```
In this example, `assertTrue` will fail because `isEven` will return `false` for a value of 3. Because this assertion has failed, `exampleTest()` will fail, regardless of any additional tests within the method.

## Practice

To test for a for a `boolean` value, what assertion method should be used?

???


* `assertTrue` 
* `assertBool` 
* `assert` 
* `assertEquals` 
* `assertBoolean`

---
## Revision

Assert if the two arrays are equal:

```
String[] a = {"a", "b", "c"};
String[] b = {"a", "b", "c"};
???(a, b);
```


* `assertArrayEquals` 
* `assert` 
* `assertTest`
