# JUnit: Specifying file locations

---
## Content

When loading data from a file system for performing a test you can use:
```java
public void setup() {
  try {
   FileInputStream inp = new FileInputStream
    ("C:\\Testing\\someData.dat");
  }
   ...
}
```
But this method of loading files during testing would not work when:
* The data is not stored on ``C:`` or is moved to another location.
* The user is testing on another platform, for example, Unix.

If the test is running from the same directory as the test data, a simple solution would be:
```java
FileInputStream inp = new FileInputStream
  ("/someData.dat");
```
However, to achieve a location-independent mechanism, a class can be mapped to a specific source directory, which would move the test data from the CM system into the classpath of the system under test:
```java
public void setup() {
  try {
    Path filePath = Path.get(getClass()
     .getResource("/data.txt").toURI());
    List<String> lines =  
     Files.readAllLines(filePath);
  }
  ...

}
```
Note that you don't have to close the stream if you're using `readAllLines()`, unlike `lines()`.

## Revision

When testing external resource files, it is recommended

???


* to move the files in the same directory as the tests
* to use the Java 8 API
* to close the input stream by yourself
