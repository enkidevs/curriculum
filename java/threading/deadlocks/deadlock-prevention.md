# Deadlock Prevention

---
## Content

In order to prevent a deadlock we must avoid at least one of the necessary conditions for it. Such can be:

 - Resource sharing i.e. more than one process can acquire the resources.
 - Processes should state which resources they require before execution.
 - Processes that hold a resource are allowed to free it before finishing execution.
 - Avoid process-resource cycles by allowing processes to require no more than one resource.

Another solution could be to have a *master* lock which would be acquired by every process before running which would exclude any opportunity for a deadlock situation.

Unfortunately none of them are perfect and they probably conflict with the whole idea of concurrency, a better solution will be discussed in the next insight.

## Revision

What is the concept of deadlock prevention?

???

What is a *master* lock?

???


* The key is to prevent a deadlock situation is to avoid one of the conditions necessary for it
* A general single lock which which is required by every process in order to run
* Hope it will not occur
* It is a lock that is acquired by a master process
