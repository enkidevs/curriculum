# Deadlocks

---
## Content

**Deadlock** is a situation in which two or more processes/threads are accessing same resources in a mutually exclusive fashion.

A simple example:


```
Thread1:
1: acquire(lock1);//takes locks
2: acquire(lock2);
3: doSomething(); //we need both locks
4: release(lock2);//releases locks
5: release(lock1);
```


```
Thread2:
1: acquire(lock2);//takes locks
2: acquire(lock1);
3: doSomething(); //we need both locks
4: release(lock1);//releases locks
5: release(lock2);
```

If we consider a situation in which `Thread1` acquires `lock1` and then `Thread2` acquires `lock2` (this can happen as these actions are not synchronized), then we end up in a **deadlock** situation as none of the two threads can proceed further.

**Deadlock** is not limited to two threads only, for example *dining philosophers* problem.

## Practice

What lines in `Thread2` should we swap to avoid a *deadlock* situation?

???


* lines 2 & 1
* lines 4 & 5
* lines 3 & 2

## Revision

What is a *deadlock*?

???


* A situation in which processes fail to acquire resources due to mutual exclusion
* A situation in which a process does not free it's resources after execution
* A situation when all resources are acquired by the processes
