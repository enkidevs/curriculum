# Detection and Recovery

---
## Content

Whenever a deadlock has occurred in the system, we can build a graph of process-resource dependencies.

One of the necessary conditions for a deadlock is a *circular wait*, i.e. somewhere in this graph there will be a cycle of process-resource dependency which is the cause of the deadlock.

There are three ways to deal with this problem:

 - Randomly kill processes in a cycle one by one and check for a deadlock after each iteration.
 - Take a resource from one process in a cycle and grant it to another one.
 - Constantly take images of the system (process-resource) and if a deadlock occurred roll back to a closest safe state.

## Revision

What is the key to resolving a deadlock once it occurred?

???


* Break the cycle of process-resource dependency
* Kill all processes in the system
* Roll the system back to a boot state
