# How to Avoid a Deadlock

---
## Content

There are 4 necessary and sufficient conditions for a **deadlock** to occur:

 - Mutual Exclusion: only one process at a time can use the resource.
 - Hold and Wait: process that is holding a resource can acquire further resources.
 - No Preemption: resources are only freed after a process has finished executing.
 - Circular Wait: there are at least two processes each waiting for each others resources.


The four main strategies on how to tackle *deadlocks* are:

- "Ostrich Algorithm" i.e. do nothing and hope that deadlocks never occur and if they happen kill processes one by one or reboot the system.
- Deadlock Detection and Recovery i.e. after system happened to be deadlocked we detect it and fix the issue.
- Deadlock Prevention i.e. ensure that at least one of the sufficient conditions for a deadlock does not hold.
- Deadlock Avoidance i.e. whenever a process/thread tries to acquire a resource the system decides whether it is safe to grant that resource or not.

The latter three will be discussed in detail in the next insights.

## Practice

What condition is not necessary for a deadlock to occur?

???


* none of the options listed
* only one process at a time can use the resource
* process that is holding a resource can acquire further resources
* resources are only freed after a process has finished executing
* at least two processes each waiting for each others resources

What is "Ostrich Algorithm"?

???


* Ignoring deadlock problem
* Solving a deadlock by running a an ostrich class
* Running an ostrich thread in a process-resource cycle
