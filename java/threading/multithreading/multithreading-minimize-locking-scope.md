# Multithreading: minimize locking scope

---
## Content

Using `Lock` is sometimes necessary to guarantee thread safety. However, overusing `Lock` will limit the performance of a program. This is because any code that operates under a `Lock` must be executed sequentially; as opposed to other areas of the program which will be able to execute concurrently.

So in order to maximize performance, it is a good idea to reduce the scope of `Lock`s to only apply to critical sections of code.
