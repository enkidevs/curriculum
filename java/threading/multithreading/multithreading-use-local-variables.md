# Multithreading: use local variables

---
## Content

Using local variables rather than class or instance variables can help prevent synchronization problems.
```
//list is a class variable
private static List list =
  Collections.synchronizedList(
  new ArrayList());
@Override
public void method(String input){
  // prefer this: 
  List list = new ArrayList();
  list.add(input);
  list.clear();
} 

```
In the example above, we attempt to save memory by reusing `list` and clearing it at the end of each call to `method()`. 

However if we have multiple interleaved method calls, then they will be sharing access to `list`. This means that the input from one method call will be visible to a separate method call. The list might also be cleared by one while another is still using it.

We can solve this problem by declaring list as a local variable inside `method()` instead. This will use more memory, but guarantee that interleaved method calls do not interfere with each-other's lists.

## Revision

When multithreading, what type of variable should be used to prevent synchronization problems? 

??? 

* local variables
* class variables
* instance variables
* threading variables
