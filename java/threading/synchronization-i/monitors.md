# Monitors

## Content

Unlike the two previous patters **monitors** are higher class synchronization mechanisms. **Monitor** functionality can be accessed by multiple threads.

We can think of a **monitor** as being is a class instance which methods are mutually exclusive so that only one thread can execute a particular method of this object at a time. **Monitors** make use of lower class synchronization patterns such as *locks* and *semaphores* in order to achieve this functionality.

Example of such class implementation:

```
class MonitorExample {
  private int counter = 0;

  //here we use 'synchronized' instead
  //of custom locks to illustrate
  //mutual exclusion of methods

  public synchronized int addOne() {
    counter += 1;
  }

  public synchronized void deleteOne() {
    counter -= 1;
  }

  public synchronized void print() {
    System.out.println(counter);
  }
}
```

* Monitor
* Lock
* Mutex
* Semaphore

## Revision

What is a monitor?

???

What is the key concept of a monitor?

???


* A high class structure that provides synchronized functionality accessible by many threads
* To provide synchronized functionality by mutually exclusive methods
* To provide more fancy output unlike punchcards and LEDs
* A pattern that allows multiple threads to use certain functionality at a single time
* A piece of hardware used to display information from a computer to the user
