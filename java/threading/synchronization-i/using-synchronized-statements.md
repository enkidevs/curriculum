# Using `synchronized` statements

---
## Content

`synchronized` statements can be used to avoid memory inconsistency errors and thread interference in multi-threaded programs.

When a thread executes code within a `synchronized` statement, the object passed as a parameter is locked.

When writing a `synchronized` block, the object providing the lock must be specified after the `synchronized` keyword:

```
public class Example {
  private int sum;
  public void addToSum(int value) {
    synchronized(this) {
      sum += value;   
    }
  }
}
```
In this example the object providing the lock is `this`, which is the instance of `Example` that the method is being called in.

You can lock instances of other classes as well:
```
public class Example{
  private MyObject mo;

  public void myMethod(){
    synchronized(mo){
      //code here
  }
}
```

## Practice

When should you use the `synchronized` keyword?

???

* More than one thread try to modify the same instance of an object.
* A single thread tries to modify the instance of an object.
* More than one thread try to modify different instances of an object.
* Never.
* Every time you use multiple threads.
