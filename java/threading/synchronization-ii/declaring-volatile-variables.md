# Declaring `volatile` variables

---
## Content

The `volatile` modifier guarantees that all threads will always see the most up-to-date value of the variable.

In the following example, the `closed` field is `volatile`. This means that if another thread calls a thread's `close` method, then the thread currently executing the `run` loop will see the change in value and terminate.

Without declaring `closed` as `volatile`, there is no guarantee that the thread would see the change in value as the compiler will only read the field `closed` once and will reuse the cached value for every execution of the loop. The loop will continue endlessly, even though we assume that the value of `closed` is changed by another running thread.

```
volatile boolean closed;
public void close() {
  closed = true;
}
public void run() {
  while (!closed) {
    ...
  }
}
```
However, `volatile` is not necessarily a replacement for `synchronized` statements as memory inconsistency errors are still possible and `volatile` does not guarantee atomicity.

## Revision

Take the following code snippet, the loop will run and loop endlessly, despite the assumption that the value of `this.done` is changed by another thread. To avoid this scenario, what keyword is used?
```java
??? boolean done;
```

* `volatile`
* `static`
* `finished`
* `checker`
