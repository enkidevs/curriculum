# `final` fields do not need to be read through `synchronized` methods

---
## Content

Using `synchronized` methods to access an object's fields is a way to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors.

For example:
```
private int x = 0;
public synchronized void getX() {
  return x;
}
```

However, fields that are declared as `final` can be safely accessed using methods that are not `synchronized`:
```
private final int x = 0;
public void getX() {
  return x;
}
```
This is is because a `final` field cannot be changed once it has been set; so there is no chance of introducing a memory consistency error.
