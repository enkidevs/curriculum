# More on Synchronization

## Content

Another way of ensuring mutual exclusion without using synchronization patters or `synchronized` is using atomic variables provided in `java.util.concurrent.atomic` library. It has to be noted that this approach is specific to Java and will only work if you are working with single variables.

Example:

```
class Counter {
  //create a new integer
  //variable with value of 0
  private AtomicInteger x =
          new AtomicInteger(0);

  public void add(value) {
      x.incrementAndGet(value);
  }

  public void decrement(value) {
      x.decrementAndGet(value);
  }

  public int getValue() {
      return x.get();
  }
}
```

There are also `booleans`, arrays, references and many other variables worth knowing about.

## Revision

What is a thread safe way of accessing and updating variables without using locks or `synchronized`?

???


* atomic variables
* electronic variables
* instant variables
