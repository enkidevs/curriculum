# Thread interruptions

---
## Content

*Interrupts* can be used to indicate that a thread should stop whatever its doing and do something else or terminate.


If any thread is in sleeping or waiting state , it will handle `interrupt()` immediately and break out of the sleeping or waiting state, throwing `InterruptedException`. If the thread is not in the sleeping or waiting state, calling the `interrupt()` method doesn't interrupt the thread but sets the *interrupt flag* to `true`, which the thread may handle after it's done with its current process.

Interrupt a `Thread`:
```java
myThread.interrupt();
```
Test whether the current `Thread` has been interrupted.
 and throw an exception:
```java
//interrupted() is a static method
if (Thread.interrupted()) {
    throw new InterruptedException();}
```
Tests whether a `Thread` object has been interrupted:
```java
myThread.isInterrupted();
```
Handle `interrupt()` signals:

```java
try {  Thread.sleep(1000);
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
```

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet to handle `interrupt`  signals:
```
try { Thread.sleep(1000); }
catch(??? e) {}
```

* `InterruptedException` 
* `InterruptException` 
* `ThreadException` 
* `ThreadInterruptException`

## Revision

Complete the following code snippet to throw the correct exception when a thread has been interrupted: 

```
if (Thread.???()) {
  throw new 
   ???();}
```

* `interrupted` 
* `InterruptedException` 
* `stopped` 
* `Exception` 
* `ThreadException` 
* `prevented` 
* `PreventedException`
