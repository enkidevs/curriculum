# Extending Thread Class

---
## Content

The easier way of creating a thread is by extending the `Thread` class since we inherit a lot of functionality from it:

Simply:
```
public class ThisIsThread
           extends Thread {
  @Override
  public void run() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      System.out.println("thread is
                      running" + i);
    }
    System.out.println("Finished!);
  }
}
```

Then in the `main` function:

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //instantiating a new thread
    ThisIsThread counter =
            new ThisIsThread();
    //starting two threads
    new ThisIsThread().start();
    counter.start();
  }
}
```

The result of running the above program would be the same as in the previous one.

**NOTE:** for better understanding of *threads* please read the *More on the Thread Class* section below.

## Practice

What function should be `Overridden` in a custom thread?

???

What function should be called in order to concurrently start a thread?

???

Should a thread object be passed to an instance of a `Thread` class?

???


* `run()`
* `start()`
* No
* Yes
* It does not matter
* `create()`

## Revision

When we create an object which extends `Thread` do we need to pass this object to an instance of a `Thread` class?

???


* No, as it is a thread itself
* Yes, as it is only a runnable object
