# Thread Sleep

---
## Content

Sometimes you might want to put a thread to `sleep` (i.e. stop its execution for some time) or `join` it (i.e. wait until it terminates). This is a very basic concept but can have many uses.

`sleep()` is implemented as a `static` method in the `Thread` class described earlier so it can be called directly on it or on any other custom thread from inside your program.

An example of using `sleep()`:
```
public class SleepingThread {
  public static void main(String args[])
    throws InterruptedException {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      //Pause for 4 seconds
      Thread.sleep(4000);
      //Print a number
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}

```

## Practice

What does `sleep()` method do?

???


* It pauses the execution of a thread for a certain time
* It waits until a thread finished executing
* It pauses all the threads in a queue
* It frees all the resources that the current thread is holding

## Revision

What method stops executing for a specified time and continues running afterwards?

???


* sleep()
* join()
* wait()
* combine()
