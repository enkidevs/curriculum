# Threading

---
## Content

**Threading** is a concept of splitting a single *process* into concurrent execution of two or more tasks. These tasks or **threads** can be run either asynchronously or synchronously and each of them has its own path of execution within the program. This concept is of course not limited to *Java* only and can be applied to many languages.

Every thread in *Java* is created and controlled by the `java.lang.Thread` class. In order to start a thread we have to call a `start()` function on it.

**NOTE:** It is important to remember that *processes* and *threads* are not the same things although they are quite similar.

Advantages of Multithreading:
- better use of system resources
- parallelized tasks
- enhanced performance on multi-processor machines

Disadvantages of Multithreading:
- increased complexity
- synchronization of shared resources (objects, data)
- difficult to debug, result is sometimes unpredictable
- potential deadlocks
- "starvation": some threads may not be served

## Practice

The concept of threading is: ???


* splitting a single process into multiple tasks
* ensuring that the current process gets the most resources out of the system
* making a process run on a single core in order to free up resources
