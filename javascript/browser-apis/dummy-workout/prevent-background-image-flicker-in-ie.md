# Prevent background image flicker in **IE**

---
## Content

**Internet Explorer** proved to have problems when loading cached background images as a flicker effect commonly appear.

A quick fix is adding this **JS** script:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
try {
document.execCommand
  ('BackgroundImageCache', false, true);
}
catch(e) {};
</script>

```

However, on **IE 10** this won't solve the problem. This version of the browser won't load cached images via **CSS**. As to solve this you need to force load the image:
```css
background-image: url('background1.jpg')

```
  In **HTML**:

```html
<img src='background1.jpg' 
style='display:none' />

```

## Practice

Force loading an image means hard-coding the image source in the html attribute *src* or in the CSS file. Bearing this in mind, complete the following snippet of code:
```
< ??? ???='enki1.jpg' 
                    style='???:none' />
```
* img
* src
* display
* source
* background-image
