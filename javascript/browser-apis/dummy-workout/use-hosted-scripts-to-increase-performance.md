# Use hosted scripts to increase performance

## Content

Many users already have downloaded scripts from the web. 

For example, they may have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting another site that uses that particular script host. 

```html
<script src="https:/.../jquery.min.js">
</script>
```

The same script will be loaded from a user's cache if they visit another website referencing the same location. This leads to faster loading time.

## Revision

What happens when you visit a webpage that uses a script **with the same host** as a page previously visited?

???

* script is loaded from cache
* script is downloaded
* script is not loaded
