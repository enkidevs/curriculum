# Modifying the Body


---

## Content

To reference the body element with the DOM you simply use `document.body` rather than selecting the body element with `getElementsByTagName` method. For example, this is how to store a reference to the body in a variable:  
`var bodyElement = document.body`  

## Overwriting the body

If you change the content of the body it will overwrite all elements inside the body.

```html
<html>
<body>
<h1>
  Welcome to my page
</h1>
<p>
  Hello World!
</p>
<p>
  My page has so much content
</p>

<script>
document
 .body
 .innerHTML = "Changed!";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the `h1` element and the two paragraph elements would be overwritten with the word "Changed!"

## Modifying the body

You can also do cool things like change the background color of the page by setting attributes on the body element:

```html
<html>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<script>
document
.body
.style
.backgroundColor = "pink";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Practice

Store a reference to the body element in a variable:

`var bodyElement = ???.???`

- `document`
- `body`
- `getElementById`
- `getElementsByTagName`
- `DOM`
- `element`
- `innerHTML`

## Revision

What happens when you changes the innerHTML of the body tag?
???

- You overwrite all elements inside the body tag with the new content.
- The content is appended to the existing content of the body tag.
- A syntax error is thrown.
