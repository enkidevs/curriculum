# ProgressEvent

---
## Content

The *`ProgressEvent`* interface is used to represent events which measure the progress of underlying processes taking place in the API. For example, an HTTP request or loading an underlying resource such as *<img>*.

*ProgressEvent Properties:*
```javascript
ProgressEvent.lengthComputable;
```
Is a boolean flag returning whether the progress made on the work to be completed is measurable. 

```javascript
ProgressEvent.loaded;
```

Is an unsigned long showing the amount of work already done by the underlying process.

```javascript
ProgressEvent.total;
```

Is an unsigned long showing the amount of work the underlying process is currently performing.



A usage example, measuring the progress of an *`XMLHttpRequest`*. 
```javascript
// progress on transfers - server to client 
function updateProgress (oEvent) {
  if (oEvent.lengthComputable) {
    var percentDone = oEvent.loaded /
                          oEvent.total;
    // ...
  } else {
    /* Unable to compute progress
     as size unknown */
  }
}
```
