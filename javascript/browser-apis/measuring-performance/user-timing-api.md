# User Timing API

---
## Content

The User Timing API is used to measure the **performance** of JavaScript code. 

The main concepts are '**mark**' (a timestamp) and '**measure**' (the time elapsed between two timestamps).

```
// timestamps named 'start' and 'end'
performance.mark("start");
// ... do something
performance.mark("end");
// measure the time elapsed
performance.measure("duration", 
                      "start", "end");
```
The main benefit of this API is that it has a higher resolution than the Date API and that you don't need to introduce variables when you test your code's performance.

## Practice

Fill the gap to compute the `duration` between `start` and `end` marks:
```javascript
performance.???("???", 
    "start", "end");

```

* `measure`
* `duration`
* `time`
* `elapsed`
* `timing`
