# `top.location.href`

---
## Content

`top.location.href` returns the location of the topmost window in the window hierarchy. If a window has no parent, `top` is a reference to itself:
```
window === window.top
```

It is useful when dealing with pages that have multiple `iframes` (e.g. map). Inside the frame, `window.location.href` returns the current frame, while `top.location.href` references the main browser window.

window === window.top
