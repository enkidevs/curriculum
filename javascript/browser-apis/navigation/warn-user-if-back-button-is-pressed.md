# Warn user if **Back** button is pressed

---
## Content

As to prevent the loss of data in some cases, you will want to warn the user before pressing the **back** button and leave the current page.

The following snippet will add a warning message if the button is pressed:

```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
  alert("Your work will be lost.");
};
```

`onbeforeunload` event handler property contains the code executed when the `beforeunload` is sent. This event fires when a window is about to unload its resources. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable.

---
## Practice

What is the name of the event listener triggered before a user leaves the webpage?

* beforeunload
* onbeforeunload
* onback
* back
* exit
* leave

```javascript
???.??? = function() {
  alert("Your work will be lost.");
};
```

* window
* onbeforeunload
* beforeunload
* ifbackpressed
* dom
* global
* events
