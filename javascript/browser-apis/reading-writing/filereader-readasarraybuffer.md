# FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()

---
## Content

The `readAsArrayBuffer()` method will read a *file* or *blob* object and produce an *ArrayBuffer*.

You cannot work with the data contained in *ArrayBuffers* directly, but can access it via a `DataView` object. The buffer and the view make together a **typed array**.

ArrayBuffers can be used to work with raw data containing complex types, convert file formats and when working with the `XmlHttpRequest` object and binary data.

Declaring a new File Reader instance.

```javascript
var reader = new FileReader();
```

Reading data as an array buffer and assign it to an array of 8 bit unsigned integers.

```javascript
reader.onload = function(e) {
  var chars  =
    new Uint8Array(reader.result);
}
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
```

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet such that the `file` object is read as an array buffer?

```javascript
var reader = new ???();
reader.???(file);
```

* FileReader
* readAsArrayBuffer
* fReader
* file-reader
* read
* interpret
* readAsArray
