# FileReader.readAsDataURL()

---
## Content

The `readAsDataURL()` method is used with file or blob objects. When the read operation is complete it returns a *data URL* with the files contents as base64 encoded string which can be access through `reader.result`.

This functionality is often used to create thumbnail previews of uploaded image files.

The HTML:
```html
<input type="file" id="file"
  onchange="triggerRead()"
  style="display:block">
<img src="" id="wallpaper">
```
And the JavaScript:
```javascript
function triggerRead() {
  var wallpaper =
    document.getElementById('wallpaper');
  var file = document.getElementById('file')
    .files[0];
  var reader  = new FileReader();

  reader.onload = function(e) {
    wallpaper.src = reader.result;
  }

  if(file) {
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  }
}
```

Here, the variable `e` stands for `Event`, which is an interface that represents any event that takes place in the DOM (Document Object Model). Some of these events are user generated (e.g. keyboard or mouse events), whilst others are generated by some APIs (e.g. when a video is paused or when all updates have been installed).
