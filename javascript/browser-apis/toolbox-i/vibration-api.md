# Vibration API

---
## Content

The Vibration API makes a device vibrate with JavaScript. It is intended to be used with mobile devices to provide additional feedback.

To check if the API is present:
```
"vibrate" in navigator
```

You can specify the number of milliseconds the device should vibrate by passing in a numeric value to the vibrate method.

To make the device vibrate for 1 second:

```
navigator.vibrate(1000);
```
You can also make the device vibrate in a **pattern** by passing in an array of millisecond values. The values alternate specifying vibration and pause time intervals.
```
// vibrate for one second,
// pause for one second,
// vibrate for two seconds then stop
navigator.vibrate([1000, 1000, 2000]);     
```
Vibration can be stopped by passing a `0` or an empty array `[]` to the vibrate method.

## Practice

Fill in the gaps to make the device vibrate for two seconds, pause for a second, then vibrate for three more seconds:

```javascript
???.???([2000, 1000,
  ???]);
```


* `navigator`
* `vibrate`
* `3000`
* `3`
* `300`
* `device`
* `object`
* `start`
* `vibration`

---
## Revision

Using the Vibration API, make the device vibrate for half a second:

```javascript
navigator.???(???);
```


* `vibrate`
* `500`
* `0.5`
* `5000`
* `start`
* `vibration`
