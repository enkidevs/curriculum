# Allow an element to go fullscreen

---
## Content

The HTML5 Fullscreen API allows an element to be viewed filling the whole screen and hiding everything else. This can be used for example to play a video without distraction. 

To view the element in fullscreen use:

```
requestFullscreen()
```
Users can leave fullscreen mode by pressing the *ESC* button and will be prompted to do so by an automatic alert. 

There are inconsistencies in the implementation of this API between browsers and specific browsers may require identifiers.
