# Network Information API

---
## Content

The *Network Information API* provides information about the system's connection. It's used to choose either high definition or low definition content for a user, dependent on their connection.

The API has a *`NetworkInformation`* interface and a single property to the Navigator interface: *`Navigator.connection`*.

This example watches for changes to the user's connection.

Declaring the connection and type.

```javascript
let connection =
  navigator.connection ||
  navigator.mozConnection ||
  navigator.webkitConnection;
let type = connection.effectiveType;
```

Listener for a change to the user's connection.

```javascript
connection.addEventListener(
  "typechange",
  updateConnectionStatus
);
```

Function to output for any change to the user's connection if called by the listener.

```javascript
function updateConnectionStatus() {
  console.log(
    "Connection type is changed \
  from " +
      type +
      " to " +
      connection.effectiveType
  );
}
```

## Practice

Declare the connection and type:

```javascript
let connection =
  ???.connection ||
  navigator.??? ||
  navigator.webkitConnection;
let type = connection.???;
```

* `navigator`
* `mozConnection`
* `effectiveType`
* `connection`
* `kind`
* `statusConnection`
* `eventConnection`

## Revision

Listen for a change in the user's connection:

```javascript
// assume connection was
// previously initialised
connection.addEventListener(
  "???",
  handlingFunction
);
```

* `typechange`
* `type`
* `change`
* `update`
* `statusChange`
