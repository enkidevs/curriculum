# Drag and Drop API

---
## Content

*Drag and Drop interfaces* allow applications to use drag and drop features in browsers. This means the user can select elements with their mouse, drag the elements to a droppable element, and drop the element by releasing the mouse button. 

Before dragging and dropping, an elements attribute must be set so it's allowed to be dragged, and the *`ondragstart`* global event handler must be added.

```html
<div draggable="true" 
 ondragstart="dragstart_handler(event);">
</div>
```
```javascript
function dragstart_handler(ev) {
  console.log("Start dragging...");
  ev.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", 
                          ev.target.id);
}
```

## Practice

Set the elements attribute so it's allowed to be dragged and at the start of the "drag" event, the `handler_function` would be triggered.

```html
<div ???="true"
   ???="handler_function(event);">
This is draggable
</div>
```


* `draggable`
* `ondragstart`
* `dragstart`
* `dragging`
* `drag`
* `todrag`
* `startdrag`
