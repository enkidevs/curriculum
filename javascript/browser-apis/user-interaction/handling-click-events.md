# Handling click events

---
## Content

JavaScript provides a way to handle different click events such as right clicks and double clicks.

Keep in mind that click events will also trigger some mouse events.

Click events supported in JavaScript:
- `click` : `mousedown` and `mouseup` events are also triggered before
- `contextmenu` : it's preceded by `mousedown` and succeded by `mouseup`
- `dblclick` : triggers two complete `click`s before the double.

The order is consistent across all browsers except **IE<9** which skips second `click` on `dblclick`.

Add a listener to these events:
```javascript
myVar.addEventListener('click',
myClickFunction);
myVar.addEventListener('dblclick',
myDoubleClickFunction);
```
To handle both single clicks and double clicks **simultaneously** a timer (around `100 ms`) should be implemented. If after a click another one is registered within the time frame, the double click function is called. Otherwise, the single click function is called.

## Practice

Add a listener to a `double click` event:

```javascript
myVar.???('???', myDoubleClickFunction);
```

* `addEventListener`
* `dblclick`
* `addListener`
* `eventListener`
* `double-click`
* `double_click`
* `doubleclick`

## Revision

Add a listener to a `click` event:
```javascript
myVar.???(???,
  myCLickFunction);
```


* `addEventListener`
* `click`
* `dblclick`
* `addClickListener`
* `false`
* `contextmenu`
