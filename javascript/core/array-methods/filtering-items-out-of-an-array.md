# Filtering Items out of an Array

---
## Content

A common pattern to filter items from an array is the following:

```js
let persons = [...];
let activated = [];
for (let person of persons) {
  if (person.isActived) {
    activated.push(person);
  }
}
```

However, using the `Array.prototype.filter` method is generally more concise and readable. With `filter()`, you **create a new array** whose elements must pass a test. Here's the simplified syntax[1]:

```js
let newArray = arr.filter(
  function callback(element) {
    // if callback returns true
    // element is kept in array
  }
);
```

You pass a callback function which is applied to every element, and if the result of `callback` is truthy then the element gets added to `newArray`. Let's take a look at an example:

```js
let numbers = [
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4
];

function isEven (element) {
  if (element % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

let even = numbers.filter(
  isEven
)
console.log(even);
// [2, 4]
```

> Note: you can use any type of array, you are not limited to a number array.

## Practice

`.filter`  can be used instead of ???.

* for and if
* if
* for and alert

## Revision

Complete the following snippet such that the `div3` variable will contain all numbers divisible by 3:

```javascript
let numbers = [
  0, 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5,
  6, 7
];

function isDivisibleBy3(element) {
  if (element % 3 ???) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

let div3 = numbers.???(
  ???
);
```

* === 0
* filter
* isDivisibleBy3
* isDivisibleBy3()
* isDivisibleBy3(element)
* !== 0
* separate

## Footnotes

[1:Syntax]
We've provided you with the simplified syntax (without any optional arguments), but here is the full one:

```js
let newArray = arr.filter(
  callback(element, index, array) {
    // if callback returns true
    // element is kept in array
  },
  thisArg
);
```

The `callback` function can take three arguments:
- `element` (mandatory)
- `index` (optional, it represents the index of the current element being processed)
- `array` (optional, it represents the array on which you call `filter()`)

Here, `thisArg` is also an optional parameter, and it represents that value that is used as `this` when executing the `callback` function.
