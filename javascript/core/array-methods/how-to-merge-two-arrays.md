# How to merge two arrays


---

## Content

`concat` is not always the best approach to merging arrays as it generates a new array.

Since `var`s are passed by reference, `concat` may mess up a reference.

Instead:

```javascript
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [4, 5, 6];
```

Merge them, adding the second one after the first one:

```javascript
Array.prototype.push.apply(array1, array2);
```

Unlike other languages, JavaScript does not support `+` for concatenating arrays. The output of such an operation would be a string:

```javascript
console.log([1, 2] + [3, 4])
// 1,23,4
```

## Practice

Suppose:

```javascript
var array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var array2 = ['d', 'e', 'f'];
```

Merge the two arrays in order:

```javascript
???.prototype.???
.???(arrray1, arrray2);
```

* push
* apply
* merge
* arrayList
* on
* after
