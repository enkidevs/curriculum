# JavaScript Functional Programming


---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `numbers` that references this array:

```plain-text
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Like above, define a variable named `filtered` that references the result of `numbers.filter()`.

The function that you pass to the `.filter()` method will look something like this:

```plain-text
    function evenNumbers (number) {
      return number % 2 === 0;
    }
```

Use `console.log()` to print the `filtered` array to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
