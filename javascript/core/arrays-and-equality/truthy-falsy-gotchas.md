## Content

You should be aware that JavaScript has a complex set of rules that contain a few gotchas about how primitive values are compared that can lead to some unexpected comparisons.

For example:

```
false == "0" //true
false == "" //true
```
**Null**

Null is also one to beware of as behaves strangely:
```
null==false //false
```

*null* and *undefined* are special and not equal to anything but themselves.

..And there are many more of these strange cases so watch out!
