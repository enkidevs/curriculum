Arrays are an important concept in JavaScript and used frequently.

Declaring an array:
```
var myArray = [1,2,3];
var anotherArray =["a","b","c"];
```

Array's are *zero based/indexed* so if you want to retrieve the first value you use 0 as the index parameter:

```
console.log(myArray[0]);
```

We can retrieve the last value of an array by using the *length* property and subtracting 1 from it (donâ€™t use this on an empty array!)

```
var arrayLength=myArray.length;
var lastVal= myArray[arrayLength-1];
console.log(lastVal);
```

Values can be added to the array with the *push* method which returns the new length of the array:
```
myArray.push(555); //4
myArray.push(5,6,7); //7
```
Or the last item can be returned and removed using *pop*:
```
myArray.pop();
```
You can find the position of any item with the *indexOf* operator:
```
var pos = myArray.indexOf(3); //2
```
We can iterate over the array items with *forEach*:
```
myArray.forEach(
function (item, index, array) {
  console.log(item, index);
}
);
```
Another cool feature of JavaScript is that you can initialize an array as such:
```JavaScript
var myArray = [,,,];
```
What this does is create an *empty* array of *size 3* (not 4, as the last comma is ignored).

## Practice

How would you get the last value in the `myArray` array?
```
var myLength = myArray.???
var last = ???[??? ???];
```
* `length`
* `myArray`
* `myLength`
* `-1`
* `+0`
* `+1`
* `array`
* `[0]`
* `.getLast`
* `.tail`

## Revision

Fill the gaps such that you get the first element of `enkiArray`:
```
var enkiArray = [1, 2, 3];
var firstElement = ??????;
```

* `enkiArray`
* `[0]`
* `[1]`
* `array`
* `getLast()`
* `getFirst()`
* `push`
* `pop`
