# Arrays


---

## Content

Arrays are an important concept in JavaScript and used frequently.

Declaring an array:

```bash
var myArray = [1,2,3];
var anotherArray =["a","b","c"];
```

Array's are *zero based/indexed* so if you want to retrieve the first value you use 0 as the index parameter:

```bash
console.log(myArray[0]);
```

We can retrieve the last value of an array by using the *length* property and subtracting 1 from it (donâ€™t use this on an empty array!)

```bash
var arrayLength=myArray.length;
var lastVal= myArray[arrayLength-1];
console.log(lastVal);
```

Values can be added to the array with the *push* method which returns the new length of the array:

```bash
myArray.push(555); //4
myArray.push(5,6,7); //7
```

Or the last item can be returned and removed using *pop*:

```bash
myArray.pop();
```

You can find the position of any item with the *indexOf* operator:

```bash
var pos = myArray.indexOf(3); //2
```

We can iterate over the array items with *forEach*:

```bash
myArray.forEach(
function (item, index, array) {
  console.log(item, index);
}
);
```

Another cool feature of JavaScript is that you can initialize an array as such:

```javascript
var myArray = [,,,];
```

What this does is create an *empty* array of *size 3* (not 4, as the last comma is ignored).

## Practice

How would you get the last value in the `myArray` array?

    var myLength = myArray.???
    var last = ???[??? ???];

* `length`
* `myArray`
* `myLength`
* `-1`
* `+0`
* `+1`
* `array`
* `[0]`
* `.getLast`
* `.tail`

## Revision

Fill the gaps such that you get the first element of `enkiArray`:

    var enkiArray = [1, 2, 3];
    var firstElement = ??????;

* `enkiArray`
* `[0]`
* `[1]`
* `array`
* `getLast()`
* `getFirst()`
* `push`
* `pop`

## Quiz

### what is the length of the array below?


```javascript
let arr = [,,,]
console.log(arr.length)
```

 ???

* 3
* 4
* 0
* 1
