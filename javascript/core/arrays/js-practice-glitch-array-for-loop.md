# JavaScript Arrays and For Loops
---
## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `pets` that references this array:
```
    ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];
```
Create a For Loop that changes each string in the array so that they are plural.

You will use a statement like this inside the for loop:
```
    pets[i] = pets[i] + 's';
```
After the for loop, use `console.log()` to print the `pets` array to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
