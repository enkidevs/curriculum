# JavaScript Arrays


---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `pizzaToppings` that references an array that contains three strings in this order: `tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni`.

Use `console.log()` to print the `pizzaToppings` array to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
