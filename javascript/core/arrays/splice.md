# Splice


---

## Content

Splice is a very useful array function that allows you to add and remove items to an array.

It accepts 3 arguments with the 3rd being optional:

* *Start* is the 0 based index of where to start manipulating the array
* *Delete* is how many items to remove at the *Start* position (can be 0)
* *Array of items to add* (optional)

We can use splice to add and remove items anywhere in the array.

For example to remove the 3rd element:

```bash
let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(myArray.splice(2, 1));
// [3]
console.log(myArray);
// [1, 2]
```

As you can see, the function returns the elements removed in case you need them.

You can also replace a sequence of elements:

```bash
console.log(myArray);
// [1, 2]
console.log(myArray.splice(0, 2, 3, 4));
// [1, 2]
console.log(myArray);
// [3, 4]
```

## Practice

Remove the `4th` and `5th` elements from the array:

    myArray.???(3, ???)

* `splice`
* `2`
* `slice`
* `remove`
* `3`
* `4`
* `5`
* `6`
* `delete`

## Revision

How would you remove the first element in the array using `splice`?

    myArray.???(???, ???);

* `splice`
* `0`
* `1`
* `2`
* `remove`
* `slice`
