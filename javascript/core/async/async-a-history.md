## Content

There are several ways of programming **asynchronously** in JavaScript. Each method was introduced as an improvement over the existing method.

**ES5 callbacks**

Use a callback function to encapsulate the continuation of the program. Some problems are "callback hell", error handling and no use of `return` or `throw`.

**ES6 promises**

Use promises as a placeholder for a future value, like an order number at a fast-food restaurant. This allows decisions to be made before the value is known.

**ES6 generators**

Pause and continue a generator function from a `yield` point. This is designed for synchronous programming but can be hacked into working asynchronously.

**ES7 async**

In ES7 it will be possible to use the `async` keyword to create an async function. The `await` keyword works similarly to `yield`.

## Practice

In ES7, it'll be possible to use the ??? keyword to create an async function. The ??? keyword works similarly to yield.

* async
* await
* return
* throw
* adjust
* apply
* generator
