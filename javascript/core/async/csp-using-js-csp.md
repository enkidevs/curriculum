## Content

"**Communicating Sequential Processes**" (CSP) is a method for **concurrent processes** to communicate during processing.

**ES6 Generators** have allowed CSP to be used in JavaScript. A popular library is _js-csp_. CSP makes it easy to express complex asynchronous flows.

Message are passed between processes via a **channel**. Each channel can have many writers and readers. It's possible to **take** a value from the channel (the taker blocks if one isn't available). Or, **put** a value on a channel (the putter blocks if a taker isn't available to take it).

For example:
```
var ch = csp.chan(); // new channel
csp.takeAsync(ch, function(value) {
   return console.log("Yay ", value);
});
csp.putAsync(ch, 100);
// puts 100 ... takes 100, "Yay 100"
```

## Practice

CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) is a method for ??? processes to ??? during processing.

* concurrent
* communicate
* synchronous
* sequential
* asynchronous
* fail
* make system calls

## Revision

Create a new csp channel:
```javascript
var ch = ???.???();
```
*`csp`
*`chan()`
*`channel()`
*`new`
*`generate()`
*`putAsync()`
*`takeAsync()`
