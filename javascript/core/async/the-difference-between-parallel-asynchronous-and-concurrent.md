## Content

'**Asynchronous**' describes tasks occurring out of order, i.e. the main program flow can continue **now** and the asynchronous task will complete **later**.

**Parallel** means more than one operation being able to occur at the same point in time. Multiple **threads** can share the same memory of a **process**. They can execute on different processors or computers.

JavaScript is **single-threaded** and so has '**run-to-completion**' behaviour (except in new ES6 syntax such as Generators), meaning that once the code in a function begins executing, it will finish before any other code can be run.

**Concurrency** is when two or more tasks are executing in the same time period, but not necessarily in parallel.

JavaScript has behaviour, known as a '**race condition**', where two concurrent tasks 'race' to see which runs first. If both alter the same data, there could be a difference in the results each time.

## Practice

JavaScript is ??? and therefore has ??? behaviour, this means that once the code in a function starts executing it has to finish before any code can run.

* single-threaded
* run-to-completion
* double-threaded
* not threaded
* run-to-crash
* run-to-memoryfull

## Revision

What's the notion describing two or more tasks executed in the same period, but not necessarily in parallel?

???

*`concurrency`
*`parallelism`
*`asynchronous`
*`race condition`
