# `NaN`

---
## Content

`NaN` stands for 'Not a Number' and is used when a number value is expected but a value which is not a number is produced.

For example, when attempting to parse a string that does not contain a number value:
```
Number("Enki"); //NaN
```
`"Enki"` cannot be converted into a valid number so `NaN` is returned.

Additionally:

```
var x = 0/0; //NaN
```
`x` will be `NaN`, which is the result of `0/0`.

## Revision

What will each of these output?
```javascript
console.log(Number("enki")); // ???
console.log(0/0 ===
   Number("five")); // ???
```
* NaN
* false
* enki
* True
* true
* 0
