# Precision

## Content

Integers are considered accurate only up to 15 digits.

```javascript
var a = 999999999999999; //15 digits
// a = 999999999999999
var b = 9999999999999999; //16 digits
// b = 10000000000000000
```
The maximum number of decimals is 17, but floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate:

```javascript
var x = 0.2 + 0.1;         
// x will be 0.30000000000000004
```

To avoid that we can multiply and divide our result as follows:

```javascript
var x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;
// x will be 0.3
```

## Practice

What are the following variable values?

```javascript
var x = 0.6 - 0.2;
???
var y = (0.2 * 10 + 0.3 * 10) / 10;
???
```

* x: 0.39999999999999997
* y: 0.5
* x: 0.4
* x: 0.6
* y: 0.49999999999999997
* y: 0.50000000000000004

## Revision

```javascript
//16 digits
var x = 9999999999999999;
console.log(x);
//x: ???
```  
* 10000000000000000 // 17 digits
* 9999999999999999 //16 digits
* 99999999999999999//17 digits
