# Types of numbers

---
## Content

Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript doesn't differentiate between types of numbers, such as integers or floating-points.

Instead, numbers are always stored as _double precision floating point numbers_, following the international `IEEE 754` standard.

This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the fraction is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63.

JavaScript also has multiple helpful constants accessible through the `Number` object:
- `Number.MIN_VALUE` = **5e-324** (the smallest possible value above 0)
- `Number.MAX_VALUE` = **1.7976931348623157e+308**
- `Number.NaN` = **NaN**
- `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`
