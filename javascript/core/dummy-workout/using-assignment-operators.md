# Using assignment operators

---
## Content

Assignment operators are a great way to reassign a value while keeping your code clean.

Instead of `x = x + y`, use `x += y`.

Assignment operators are particularly useful in loops:

```
var list = [1, 2, 3];
var sumOfSquares = 0;
for (i = 0; i < list.length; i++) { 
  sumOfSquares += Math.pow(list[i], 2);
}
```

Other examples of assignment operators include `-=`, `*=`, `/=` and `%=`.

## Practice

Choose the right operator for each step to end up with x equal to 7:
```javascript
var x = 5;
x ??? 4; // make x == 20
x ??? 2; // then, make x == 10
x ??? 3; // lastly, make x == 7
```
* *=
* /=
* -=
* ++
* =>

## Revision

`x = x + y` can be shortened using ??? 

* x += y
* x ++ y
* x =+ y
