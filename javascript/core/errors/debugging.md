# Debugging

---
## Content

One of the most common debugging options is the **browser tools**. 

Each browsers tools are slightly different but all will contain a debugger and console where you can add breakpoints, inspect variables etc.

On most browsers the debugging features can be brought up with the **F12** key. 

**debugger;**

If you want the debugger to stop on a line of code and dont want to add a breakpoint you can add the statement `debugger;` in your code. Then if the browser tools are open the debugger will stop when it reaches this statement.

**Logging Variables**

It can be useful to find out the values of variables when debugging code. 

Some developers will use an alert statement to do this:
```
alert(myVar);
```
A better way is to use the console.log statement to write the variables value out to the console:
```
console.log(myVar); 
```
