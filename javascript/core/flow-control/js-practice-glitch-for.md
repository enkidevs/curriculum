# JavaScript For Loops
---

## Exercise


In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `total` and make it equal the number `0`.

Define a second variable named `limit` and make it equal the number `10`.

Create a for loop with a variable `i` starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each time through the loop. The loop should run as long as `i` is less than `limit`.

On each iteration of the loop, add the number `i` to the `total` variable. To do this, you can use this statement:

    total += i;

After the for loop, use `console.log()` to print the `total` variable to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
