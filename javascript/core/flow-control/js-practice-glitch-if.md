# JavaScript If Statements


---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, declare a variable named `fruit`.

Make the `fruit` variable reference the value `orange` with the type of `String`.

Then use `console.log()` to print "The fruit name has more than five characters." if the length of the value of `fruit` is greater than five.
Otherwise, print "The fruit name has five characters or less."

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
