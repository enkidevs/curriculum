## Exercise
In the file named `answer.js`, define a function named `eat` that takes an argument named `food` that is expected to be a string.

Inside the function return the `food` argument like this:

    return food + ' tasted really good.';

Inside of the parentheses of `console.log()`, call the `eat()` function with the string `bananas` as the argument.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
