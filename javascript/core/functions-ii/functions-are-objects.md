Every function in JavaScript is also an object.

This means we can assign a function to a variable which can be used to execute the function - this is called a *function expression*:

```
var x = function myFunc(x,y){
	return x+y;
};

x(1,2);//3
```

But why do this?

One reason is to pass functions into other functions.

A somewhat contrived example would be if we were creating a calculator we could pass different calculation expressions into the *calc* function and avoid repeating the console logging code:

```
function calc(expression){
   console.log(expression(2,1));
}

var add = function(x, y){
   return x + y;
}

var subtract = function(x, y){
   return x - y;
}

calc(add);//3
calc(subtract);//1
```

We donâ€™t even need to give our functions a name.

This is called an anonymous function:

```
var x = function(x, y){
	return x + y;
}
x(1,2);
```

## Practice

Complete the function expression in the following code snippet such that it makes sense:
```
??? x = ??? add(x, y, z){
    ??? x + y + z;
}
console.log(x(1, 2, 3));
```

*`var`
*`function`
*`return`
*`console.log`
*`get`
*`fn`
*`()`
