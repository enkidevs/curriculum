## Content

In JavaScript `this` represents the **context** of a function. The code currently executing belongs to the object that `this` references.

If you call an **unbound** function, `this` will default to the **global context** or `Window` object in the browser. 

If you execute a function in **strict mode**, the context will default to `undefined`.

If you call a function as a **method** of an object, `this` is set to the object the method is called on.

If you create a `new` instance of an object to call a function, `this` is set to the newly created instance.

You can use `bind()` to avoid confusion by specifying the `this` to use when calling a function.
