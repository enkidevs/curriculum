## Content

Variable declarations are moved to the top of the current scope, either the current function or script. This means that variables can be used before they are declared.
```
x = 5;
alert(x);
var x;
```
`5` will be alerted despite `var x` not being declared until after the alert. 

However, variable initializations are not hoisted:
```
alert(x)
var x = 5;
```
This alert will produce `undefined` because, although `var x` is hoisted to the beginning of the script, `x` is not initialized to the value of `5` until after the alert.
