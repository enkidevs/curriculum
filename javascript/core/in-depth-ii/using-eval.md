`eval` ("evil") evaluates the string passed to it as Javascript code:
```
var str = "if(a){1+2;} else{1+3;}";
var a = true;
var b = eval(str);  // returns 3
```
Avoid using `eval` if there is an alternative. Code generally runs more slowly if `eval  ` is used because it has to disable optimisations.

The security of `eval` is poor. The string could be changed by a third party extension to produce malicious code.

Third party code can access the scope in which `eval()` was called and this can also lead to attacks.
