# Using `eval`

---
## Content

`eval` evaluates the string passed to it as Javascript code:

```js
let str = "if(a){1+2;} else{1+3;}";
let a = true;
let b = eval(str);  // returns 3
```

The general practice is to avoid using `eval` if there is an alternative. Code usually runs slower if `eval` is used because it has to disable optimisations. 

The security of `eval` is poor. The string can be changed by a third party extension to produce malicious code.

Third party code can access the scope in which `eval()` was called and this can also lead to attacks.

This is why `eval` is sometimes refered to as "evil".

* `16`
