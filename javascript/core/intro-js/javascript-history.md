# JavaScript History

Before we jump in, a few words on JavaScript history. It was initially developed by **Brendan Eich** in just *10 days* under the code name *Mocha* in May 1995. 

The first version of JavaScript was actually called *LiveScript* but this was later changed to JavaScript. 

Although JavaScript has the word “Java” in the title, the language has nothing to do with Java (probably a marketing ploy to capitalise on Java's popularity at the time). 

Whilst some of JavaScript’s methods and syntax are similar to Java, JavaScript owes more to languages such as *Scheme* and *Self*.
