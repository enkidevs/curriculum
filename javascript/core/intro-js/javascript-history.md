# JavaScript History

---

## Content

Before we jump in, a few words on JavaScript history. It was initially developed by **Brendan Eich** in just _10 days_ under the code name _Mocha_ in May 1995.

The first version of JavaScript was actually called _LiveScript_ but this was later changed to JavaScript.

Although JavaScript has the word “Java” in the title, the language has nothing to do with Java (probably a marketing ploy to capitalise on Java's popularity at the time).

Whilst some of JavaScript’s methods and syntax are similar to Java, JavaScript owes more to languages such as _Scheme_ and _Self_.
