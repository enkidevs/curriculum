## Content

The language that would become JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 and then standardized by an organization called ECMA as **EcmaScript-262**. The standardization was needed as two versions of the initial JavaScript (Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript) came out, similarly enough to be considered "versions", but different enough to cause confusion.

 What EcmaScript does is to provide a schema which regulates the underlying behavior of the implementing languages.

The current JavaScript is considered a **dialect** (or implementation) of EcmaScript, but there are other popular dialects in use such as Adobeâ€™s ActionScript.

At the time of writing the current version of EcmaScript is **EcmaScript 2015** which is also sometimes referred to as **EcmaScript 6** or just **ES6**.

**EcmaScript and Web Pages**

EcmaScript has no methods for manipulating or working with web pages.

When people use the word JavaScript they are usually referring to EcmaScript and extensions such as the **DOM** (Document Object Model) that defines methods for manipulating web pages and the **BOM** (Browser Object Model) that provide functionality for working with the browser.

In conclusion, JavaScript and EcmaScript are not exactly the same, but the development of the JavaScript language is driven by the new standards introduced in revised versions of EcmaScript.
