# JavaScript Variables

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, declare a variable named `example`.

Make the variable example equal to the value `'some string'`.

Then use `console.log()` to print the example variable to the console.

Check to see if your program is correct by clicking Show.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
