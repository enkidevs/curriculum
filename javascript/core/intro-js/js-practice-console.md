# JS Practice logging to the console


---

## Exercise

For the first set of exercises, we'll be using a platform called Glitch. This is an in-browser Development Environment that you can use to practice your JavaScript. You can "Remix" a project to copy it to your own account and make changes.

In this exercise, you'll practice logging to the JavaScript console on Glitch.
