# Infix operators are left-associative

---
## Content

Operator associativity determines the order in which operators of the same type are evaluated.

Operations are processed from the left-hand side of an equation:

```js
let x = a - b - c;
```

The example is evaluated in the following way:

```js
let x = (a - b) - c;
```

These parentheses can be safely omitted without affecting the outcome of the equation. However, if you wish to evaluate the right-hand side of the equation first, then parentheses must be used:

```js
let x = a - (b - c);
```

## Practice

What does the following JS code output? ???

```javascript
let a = 20;
let b = 4;
let c = 12;

let x = a - (-b * c);
console.log(x);
```


* 68
* -28
* 192
* 0
* undefined
* -68
* -192

## Revision

The processing of operations starts with the ??? operator if no parentheses are used.
