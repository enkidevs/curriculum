var x = Infinity - Infinity;
console.log(x); //prints ???
```
* `NaN`
* `0`
* `Infinity`
%exp
Infinity could be any number, so we canâ€™t represent the result of `Infinity - Infinity` as a fixed value.

```
var x = -10/0;
console.log(x); //prints ???
```
* `-Infinity`
* `Infinity`
* `0`
%exp
There is also an option for a number to be infinitely small, which is represented by `-Infinity`.

```
var x = Infinity * 10;
console.log(x); //prints ???
```
* `Infinity`
* `NaN`
* `-Infinity`
%exp
Any fixed number multiplied by `Infinity` gives us infinity.

```
var x = 10/-0;
console.log(x); //prints ???
```
* `-Infinity`
* `Infinity`
* `NaN`
%exp
Dividing a positive number by a negative 0 results in a negative `Infinity`.
