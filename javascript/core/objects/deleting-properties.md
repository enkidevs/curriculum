# Deleting properties


---

## Content

Setting the property to `null` or `undefined` only removes the value associated with given property. It does not remove the key.

```bash
var obj = { one: 1 }
```

Setting to `undefined`:

```bash
obj.one = undefined;
console.log(obj); // { one: undefined }
```

Setting to `null`:

```bash
obj.one = null;
console.log(obj); // { one: null }
```

To delete:

```bash
delete obj.one;
console.log(obj); // { }
```

Using the `delete` operator returns `true` for all cases except when the property is an own non-configurable property, in which case, `false` is returned in non-strict mode.

## Practice

Complete the code snippet:

```javascript
var test = {
  prop1: 1,
  prop2: 2
}
// set prop1 to undefined
test.prop1 = ???;
//remove prop2
??? ;
```

* undefined
* delete test.prop2
* null
* delete prop2

## Revision

What is the output of the following code snippet?

```javascript
var obj = { one: 1 }
obj.one = undefined;
console.log(obj);
// ???
```

* `{ one: undefined }`
* `{ one: null }`
* `{ }`
