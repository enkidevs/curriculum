## Exercise
In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `food` like this:

    var food = {
      types: 'only pizza'
    };

Use `console.log()` to print the `types` property of the `food` object to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
