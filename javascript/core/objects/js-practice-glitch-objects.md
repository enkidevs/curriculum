# JavaScript Objects

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `pizza` like this:

```plain-text
    var pizza = {
      toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],
      crust: 'deep dish',
      serves: 2
    };
```

Use `console.log()` to print the `pizza` object to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
