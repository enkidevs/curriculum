# Keywords in hash keys


---

## Content

Object properties can either be presented as strings or plain characters.

```javascript
var testObject = {
  'case': 'Random string',
  delete: 'Another random string'
}
```

However, it is considered bad practice to leave special keywords such as `delete` unquoted as it may confuse readers and syntax highlighter.

Instead, you can use quotes:

```javascript
var testObject = {
  'case': 'Random string',
  'delete': 'Another random string'
}
```

Using unquoted keywords can also be bad for portability and would raise a `Syntax Error` with old JavaScript engines.

## Practice

When do you need to quote object properties names in older JavaScript engines?

???

* when the name is a special keyword
* always
* never
* when the property type is "string"
* only when the property name is "delete"

## Revision

How would you rewrite the commented object property in order to avoid `Syntax Error` with old JS engines?

```javascript
var dog = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: '5',
  // typeof: 'beagle'
  ??? ???
}
```

* 'typeof':
* typeof
* type of
* 'beagle'
* beagle
* 'name'
* name
* 'typeof'
* typeof:
