## Content

Object properties can either be presented as strings or plain characters.

```
var testObject = {
  'case': 'Random string',
  delete: 'Another random string'
}
```

However, it is considered bad practice to leave keywords such as `delete` unquoted as it may confuse readers and syntax highlighter.


Instead, you can use quotes:

```
var testObject = {
  'case': 'Random string',
  'delete': 'Another random string'
}
```

Using unquoted keywords can also be bad for portability and would raise a `Syntax Error` with old JavaScript engines.

## Revision

How would you rewrite the commented object property in order to avoid `Syntax Error` with old JS engines?

```javascript
var dog = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: '5',
  // typeof: 'beagle'
  ??? ???
}
```
* `'typeof':`
* `typeof`
* `type of`
* `'beagle'`
* `beagle`
* `'name'`
* `name`
* `'typeof'`
* `typeof:`
