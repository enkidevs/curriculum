# Object - Part 1

---

## Content

JavaScript has a special type called _Object_ which is a collection of keys and values.

Pretty much everything apart from primitive values inherit from this special type.

**Creating objects**

There are a couple of ways to create objects in JavaScript.

Probably the most common is with the object initializer method:

```javascript
var per = {
  firstName: "john",
  lastName: "smith"
};
```

**Accessing object properties**

Objects have properties which can be both primitive values and functions.

These properties are generally accessed via dot notation.

We can access our person objects name with the dot syntax:

```
console.log(per.firstName); //john
```

We can also access properties using the array syntax.

This can be useful when you donâ€™t know the name of the property you want and want to dynamically change it at runtime.

```javascript
var propName = "firstName";
console.log(per[propName]);
```

We can even add properties anytime we want to our objects:

```javascript
per.age = "40";
per["homeTown"] = "London";
```

## Practice

Consider the following object:

```javascript
var car = {
  model: "AwsomeCar",
  color: "blue",
  noDoors: 4
};
var test = "model";
```

Would the following line print "model"?

```javascript
console.log(car.test); // ???
```

- no
- yes

## Revision

Which line adds a new property to an object that looks like this:

```javascript
var per = {
  firstName = "John",
  lastName = "Smith"
};
???
```

- `per.age = 40;`
- `var per.age = 40;`
- `per[age] = 40;`
- `per.addNewProperty(age,40);`
