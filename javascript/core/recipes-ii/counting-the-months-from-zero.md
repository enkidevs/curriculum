# Counting the Months From Zero

---
## Content

The months of the year in a date object begin counting from zero.

```javascript
let date = new Date(2015, 1, 21);
console.log(date);
```

The date will not be the 21st of January, but instead this date object represents: `Sat Feb 21 2015 00:00:00 GMT-700`.

To print the 21st of January, use month `0`:

```javascript
let date = new Date(2015, 0, 21);
console.log(date);
```

Similarly, using the 12th month of 2015 in a date object will print January of 2016:

```javascript
let date = new Date(2015, 12, 21);
console.log(date);
// date = Thur Jan 21 2016 00:00:00
```
