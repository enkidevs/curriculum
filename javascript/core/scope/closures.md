# Closures


---

## Content

A **closure** is created when a function is created and includes both the function and its surrounding scope.

When functions are nested, a closure gives the inner function access to the outer functionâ€™s scope.

For example, you can return the inner function `bar()` from the outer function `foo()` and `bar` will still maintain access to the local variables and arguments of the outer function `foo()`:

```js
function foo(val) {
  let code = "coding is";
  
  return function bar() {
    // bar has access to code
    // and to val even after
    // it is returned from foo
    return code + " " + val;
  };
}

let bar = foo("fun");
bar(); // "coding is fun"
```

Which is the same as:

```js
foo("fun")(); // "coding is fun"
```

Closures allow us to emulate "private" variables using nested functions, by hidding them in the outer function's scope, and thus making them available only to the returned inner function.

## Practice

This code ??? run:

```javascript
function foo() {
  let localVariable = "lVar";
  return function bar() {
    return localVariable;
  };
}
foo()();
```

* will
* will not

## Revision

A *closure* is created when a function is ???.

* created
* called
* nested
