# Hoisting Applies Only to Variable Declarations


---

## Content

Variable declarations using `var` are moved to the top of the function scope (or global scope if outside of a function). One consequence of this is that variables can be used before they are declared.

```js
x = 5;
alert(x); // 5
var x;
```

`5` will be alerted despite `var x` not being declared until after the alert. 

Note that it's only the declarations but not initializations that are hoisted:

```js
alert(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```

This alert will produce `undefined` because, although the declaration `var x` is hoisted to the top, `x` is not initialized to the value of `5` until after the alert.

The code above can be thought of as behaving like this:

```js
var x; // hoisted declaration
alert(x); // undefined
x = 5; // initialization
```

## Practice

The following code will output ???

```javascript
s = "enki";
console.log(s);
var s;
```

- enki
- undefined
- nothing

## Revision

The following code outputs ???

```javascript
console.log(v);
var v = "enki";
```

- undefined
- enki
- nothing
