# Multi-Line String Variables

---
## Content

For readability, it may be preferable to write strings over multiple lines:

```javascript
let stringOfHTML = "<div>
  This is a bad example.
</div>";
```
However, this will cause an error. 


To preserve both readability and functionality, use string concatenation:

```javascript
let stringOfHTML = '<div>' +
  '  This is a better example.' +
'</div>';
```

Or, since ES2015, it is possible to use backticks (`` ` ``), in this form:

```javascript
let stringOfHTML = `This is a 
multi-line
string in ES6!`;
```
