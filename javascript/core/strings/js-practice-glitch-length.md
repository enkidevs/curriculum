# Strings and length


---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, create a variable named `example`.

Assign the string `'example string'` to the variable `example`.

Use `console.log` to print the length of the string to the terminal.

Click Show to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
