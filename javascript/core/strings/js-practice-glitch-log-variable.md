# JS Practice Strings
---
## Exercise

For this challenge, in the file named `answer.js`, create a variable named `someString` like this:

```
var someString = 'this is a string';
```

Use `console.log` to _print the variable_ `someString` to the terminal.
Click Show to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
