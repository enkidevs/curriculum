## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `pizza` that references this string: `'pizza is alright'`

Use the `.replace()` method to change `alright` to `wonderful`.

Use `console.log()` to print the results of the `.replace()` method to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
