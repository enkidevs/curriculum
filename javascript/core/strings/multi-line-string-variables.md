## Content

For readability, it may be preferable to write strings over multiple lines:

```javascript
var stringOfHTML = "<div>
  This is a bad example.
</div>";
```
However, this will cause an error.


To preserve both readability and functionality, use string concatenation:

```javascript
var stringOfHTML = '<div>' +
  '  This is a better example.' +
'</div>';
```

Or, ES2015 makes it possible to use backticks, in this form:

```
var stringOfHTML = `This is a
multi-line
string in ES6!`;
```
