## Content

Generally, double and single quotes are handled the same way.

```
str1 = 'I\'m a string.';
str2 = "I'm a string.";
```
`str1` and `str2` output the same string but `str2` is easier to read since it doesn't require an escape character in `I'm`.

JSON standards *require* strings to be double quoted. For consistency, some developers prefer to stick to double quotes on all strings.

However, modern linters often recommend using single quotes in JavaScript, with double quotes reserved for HTML only.
