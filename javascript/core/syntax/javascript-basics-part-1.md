# JavaScript Basics - Part 1

Like most programming languages, JavaScript has a number of rules its code must adhere to.

**Case Sensitivity**

Everything in JavaScript is case sensitive.

**Keywords**

Like most languages there are a number of reserved words in JavaScript that you cannot use to name your functions and variables.

**Identifier naming rules**

When naming any function, property or variable, the first character must be a letter, $ sign or underscore.

After the first character you are free to use numbers, letters, dollar signs or underscores.

```javascript
var name = "Enki"; //valid
var 2Company = "Enki"; //not valid
```

**Comments**

Comments can be created in 2 ways in JavaScript.

As a single line comment:

```//I am a single line comment```

You can also add single line comments to the same line as other code:

```
var company="enki"; //define company ```

Or if you have more text you can use a block comment:
```
/*
I am a block comment
*/
```
