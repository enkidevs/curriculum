# JavaScript Basics - Part 2


---

## Content

Like most programming languages, JavaScript has a number of syntax rules that must be adhered to.

### Semicolon

In EcmaScript it is best practice to add a semicolon at the end of a statement:

```javascript
var company="enki";
```

Itâ€™s not strictly necessary to do this as the parser will try to determine the end of a statement automatically. However, it will help you be sure that the code runs as expected.

### Variables

Variables are declared with the `var` operator which creates a variable in the *current scope*.

For example, if this is used inside a function then the variable will exist only inside the function:

```javascript
function hello(){
   var company="enki";
}
// variable out of scope
```

If you omit the `var` keyword and are not in strict mode then a variable will still be declared but it will be declared in global scope. When this occurs on a web page, global scope is the `window` object.

Not using `var` is a very bad idea as it is easy for variables to overwrite (sometimes called clobber) other variables.
