# Truthy Falsy


---

## Content

All values in JavaScript have a special inherit *boolean* value of either *true* or *false*.

The following are always considered false or falsy values:

* null
* 0
* false
* "" (empty string)
* undefined
* NaN (Not A Number)

Every other value is considered to have a value of true.

This includes some things you might not expect such as:

* Empty objects
* The string version of zero e.g. "0"
* Empty arrays and functions

**But why is this important?**

This is often used as a shortcut for conditional logic such as testing if an object is null.

For example as *null* or *undefined* objects have an inherent value of *false* we can use this with an if statement to perform different logic:

```bash
if (myObj){
   //object exists
}
else {
   //object does not exist
}
```

## Practice

A null object is ???.

* falsy
* truthy
* neither falsy nor truthy.

## Revision

An empty string is ???.

* falsy
* truthy
* neither falsy nor truthy
