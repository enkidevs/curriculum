# JavaScript Variables
---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `roundUp` that references the float `1.5`.

We will use the `Math.round()` method to round the number up. This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

An example of using `Math.round()`:

    Math.round(0.5);

Define a second variable named `rounded` that references the output of the `Math.round()` method, passing in the `roundUp` variable as the argument.

Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
