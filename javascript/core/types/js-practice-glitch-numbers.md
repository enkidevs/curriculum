# JavaScript Variables


---

## Exercise

In the file named `answer.js`, define a variable named `example` that references the integer `123456789`.

Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

Click `Show` to check to see if your program is correct.
Be sure to Remix the project, and turn that in as your solution.
