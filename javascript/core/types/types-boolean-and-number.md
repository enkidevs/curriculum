# Types - Boolean and Number


---

## Content

### Boolean

The Boolean type has two options: *true* or *false* (these are specified as lower case):

```javascript
var isCold = true;
var isHot = false;
```

### Number

JavaScript supports both whole and decimal numbers all using the same number type:

```javascript
var numberOfMonths=12;
var temperature=17.2;
```

You can perform simple maths calculations using the following operators:

```javascript
1+2; //add
9/3 //divide
1*5 //multiply
9-5 //subtract
10%4 //modulus (division remainder)
```

More math functionality is available via the `Math` object e.g.

```javascript
Math.round(5.7);//6
```

## Practice

One the first line declare a **boolean** variable named `a` that's true.
On the second line declare a **number** variable named `b` with the value equal to `3.14`.

```javascript
var ??? = ???
??? ??? = ???
```

* a
* true
* var
* b
* 3.14
* "3.14"
* True
* "true"
* const
* number
* boolean
* '3.14'
* 'true'
