# Types - Boolean and Number

---
## Content

**Boolean**

The Boolean type has two options: *true* or *false* (these are specified as lower case):

```
var isCold = true;
var isHot = false;
```

**Number**

JavaScript supports both whole and decimal numbers all using the same number type: 
```
var numberOfMonths=12;
var temperature=17.2;
```

You can perform simple maths calculations using the following operators:

```
1+2; //add
9/3 //divide
1*5 //multiply
9-5 //subtract
10%4 //modulus (division remainder)

```

More math functionality is available via the Math object e.g.

```
Math.round(5.7);//6
```
