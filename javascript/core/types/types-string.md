# Types - String


---

## Content

You can declare a string value in JavaScript using either single or double quotes - JavaScript will accept either:

```bash
var company = "Enki";
var company = 'Enki';
```

If you have longer text you can wrap multiple lines by using the + operator:

```bash
var longerText = "abc" +
		"def" +
		"ghi";
```

You can also use the backslash character to continue writing text on multiple lines (make sure nothing is after the backslash).

```bash
var longerText = "abc\
def\
ghi";
```

There are also special characters that can be used by preceding the character with a backslash. Here are some common ones:

```bash
\â€™ single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n new line
\r character return
\t tab
```
