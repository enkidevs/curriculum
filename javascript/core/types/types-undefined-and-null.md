**undefined**

A variable is of *undefined* type when it is created but not set to a value:
```
var company;
typeof company; //undefined
```

Note that if the **typeof** operator is used on a variable that has never been defined it will also return as undefined:

```
typeof randomName; //undefined
```

**null**

null is used to represent a deliberate absence of a value:
```
var myNullValue=null;
```

Confusingly, if you compare null and undefined you will find they are equal when using the standard equals comparison (this will convert types):

```
null  == undefined //true
```
But when using strict comparison (this does not change types) they are not equal:

```
null === undefined //false
```
