# Types - Undefined and Null


---

## Content

**undefined**

A variable is of *undefined* type when it is created but not set to a value:

```bash
var company;
typeof company; //undefined
```

Note that if the **typeof** operator is used on a variable that has never been defined it will also return as undefined:

```bash
typeof randomName; //undefined
```

**null**

null is used to represent a deliberate absence of a value:

```bash
var myNullValue=null;
```

Confusingly, if you compare null and undefined you will find they are equal when using the standard equals comparison (this will convert types):

```bash
null  == undefined //true
```

But when using strict comparison (this does not change types) they are not equal:

```bash
null === undefined //false
```

## Practice

Not initializing a variable sets its value to ???.

* undefined
* null
* the default one

## Revision

What will the following statement evaluate to?

    undefined == null
    // ???

* true
* false
