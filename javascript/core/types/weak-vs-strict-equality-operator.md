# Weak vs Strict equality operator

---
## Content

JavaScript supports two forms of equality.

### Weak Typing

The operator `==` coerces (converts) types before comparing the terms:

```js
0 == "" // true
5 == "5" // true
false == "0" // true
"enki" == "enki" // true
```

Using `==` is generally considered bad practice as it often leads to difficult-to-locate bugs due to unexpected type conversions.

> ðŸ’¡ The **weak equality operator** (`==`) is also refered to as **loose** or **abstract**.

### Strict Typing

The strict equality operator `===` works as `==`, but without type coercion:

```js
0 === "" // false
5 === "5" // false
false === "0" // false
"enki" === "enki" // true
```

---
## Practice

Match the type name with the operator:

```plain-text
==  - ???
=== - ???
```

Fill in the gaps with the correct equality operator to get the output:

```js
"19" ??? 19
// true

"nk" ??? "nk"
// true
```
