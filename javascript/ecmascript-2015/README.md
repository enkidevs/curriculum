standards:
  new-declaration-keywords:
    name: Use new variable declaration keywords to communicate more effectively with other developers
    description: This standard deals with knowledge of the behavior of let and const and their proper use.
    objectives:
      0: Use let for block-scoped variables
      1: Use const for variables that will not change
  es6-extensions-standard-library:
    name: Use extensions to JavaScriptâ€™s standard library to perform data analysis and manipulation
    description: This standard covers improvements to existing data structures and other standard library utilities that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
    objectives:
      0: Use new Object static methods
      1: Use new Array static and prototype methods
      2: Use new String static and prototype methods and properties
      3: Use new Number static and prototype methods and properties
      4: Use new Math methods
      5: Use new RegExp syntax extensions
  es6-functions:
    name: Use updates to functions to create more expressive functions
    description: This standard covers the updates to the function syntax to support more functional programming capabilities in JavaScript.
    objectives:
      0: Use Arrow Functions
      1: Use Generator Functions
      2: Use parameter defaults
      3: Use the rest operator ... to capture additional parameters
  es6-data-structures:
    name: Use new data structures and their features to store data
    description: This standard deals with new built-in data structures in JavaScript and their use to effectively store data.
    objectives:
      0: Use Set and it's methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      1: Use Map and it's methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      2: Use WeakSet and it's methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      3: Use WeakMap and it's methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      4: Use Typed Arrays and their methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      5: Use DataViews and their methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      6: Use Symbol and it's methods to effectively store and retrieve data
      7: Use the spread operator (...) to spread a collection
  destructuring:
    name: Use destructuring syntax to operate on data in collection
    description: This standard deals with all forms of destructuring syntax, introduced in ES6.
    objectives:
      0: Use destructuring syntax with arrays
      1: Use destructuring syntax with objects
      2: Use destructuring syntax to assign default values in objects
      3: Use destructuring syntax with strings
      4: Use destructuring syntax with computed property names
      5: Use destructuring syntax to unpack field names from objects passed as a function parameter
      6: Use destructuring syntax to iterate over collections
  es6-class:
    name: Use prototypes to create class-like objects in JavaScript
    description: This standard covers using the class and extends keywords, and constructor function with super.
    objectives:
      0: Use the class keyword to declare a class, using the constructor function
      1: Use the extends keyword to inherit from another class, and use super in the constructor function
  native-promises:
    name: Use native Promises to manage asynchronous operations
    description: This standard deals with the use of native promises, and their methods. It does not cover the use of Bluebird, or any other promise library.
    objectives:
      0: Use the Promise constructor to create a new promise
      1: Use .then to await promise resolution
      2: Use .catch to catch errors
      3: Use .all to await multiple promises
      4: Use .resolve to resolve a promise
      5: Use .reject to reject a promise
      6: Use .race to race promises
  async-await:
    name: Use async await to manage asynchronous operations
    description: This standard deals with async and await keywords and their use to manage asynchronous operations.
    objectives:
      0: Write an async function that performs an asynchronous task
      1: Use the await keyword to pause execution in an async function until a promise resolves
  iterators-generators:
    name: Use iterators and generators to process collections
    description: This standard deals with the iteration protocol in JavaScript as defined in ES6, and generators, and their use to process a collection or respond dynamically to evented input.
    objectives:
      0: Use for..of loops to iterate over a collection by value
      1: Use generator functions to yield a sequence
      2: Use a generator to invert control
      3: Use a generator to manage asynchronous activity by suspending execution until after a promise has resolved
  es6-proxies:
    name: Use Proxies to define custom behavior for fundamental operations in JavaScript
    description: This standard deals with the use of Proxies and Reflect to handle property lookup and assignment, enumeration, and function invocation.
    objectives:
      0: Use a Proxy to handle property lookup and assignment
      1: Use a Proxy to handle function invocation
      2: Use Reflect to use the internal default behavior of proxy methods
  es6-modules:
    name: Use native ES6 Modules to import code
    description: Use the native ES6 `import` syntax to import a module, as distinct from the CommonJS `require()`
    objectives:
      0: Import a module
      1: Import named components of a module
      2: Export a module
      3: Export multiple named components of a module
