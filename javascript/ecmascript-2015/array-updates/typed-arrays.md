# Typed Arrays

---
## Content

Typed arrays are array-like objects providing a mechanism for accessing raw binary data. Usually they're used to implement network protocols, cryptography algorithms, file format manipulations, and so on.

Typed arrays are made up of `buffers` and `views`.
A buffer (implemented by an `ArrayBuffer` object) is an object that represents some data but does not provide a way to access its contents.
That's when the view comes in - it provides a data type, starting offset, and number of elements.

Create a chunk of data 16 bytes long:

```javascript
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
```

Create a view that treats the data as 32-bit signed integers:

```javascript
let int32View = new Int32Array(buffer);
```

Now the typed array is indexed and accessible:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < int32View.length; i++) {
  int32View[i] = i * 2;
}
```
