# Destructuring (Part 2)

---
## Content

Destructuring can also be used to work with objects.

### Specifying where to assign variables

Sometimes when using destructuring you will want to specify where values should be assigned - this can be done as follows:

```javascript
var source =
{company: "Enki", topic: "js"};

var {company:v1, topic:v2} = source;
//v1 = "Enki"
//v2 = "js"

```

### Default Properties

You can also assign a default value that will be used when destructuring if a source object doesnâ€™t have a matching property.

Below the default value of `200` will be used for variable `y` as the source object does not have a `y` property.

Note how `x`'s default is overwritten as the `x` property exists:

```javascript
var {x = 1, y = 200} = {x: 100};
//x = 100, y = 200
```

---
## Practice

What will be the value of `a` at the end of the code execution?

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 'b'
}

const {a: b, c = 'a'} = obj
// a = ???
```

* undefined
* 'b'
* c
* b
* obj
* null
* 'a'

## Revision

Complete the destructuring assignment such that the log statements are correct:

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 3
}

const {??? ??? ???,
  ??? ??? ??? } = obj;
console.log(foo)
// 3
console.log(bar)
// 20
```

* a
* :
* foo
* bar
* =
* 20
* as
* 3
* ==
* : foo
* : bar
* : 20
