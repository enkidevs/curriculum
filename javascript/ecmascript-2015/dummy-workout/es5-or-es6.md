%

%

function* ()
%exp
Generator functions in ES6, are functions that can be exited and later re-entered.
%

{v}
%exp

%

Promise
%exp
Promise objects are used for asynchronous computations.
It was introduced in ES6.
%

Proxy
%exp
A type of object introduced in ES6.

This object enables the user to define custom behaviour for fundamental operations.
%

for (x of object)
%exp
The `for...of` syntax loops over an iterable object.

It was introduced before ES6.
%

null
%exp
The first version to support `null` is ES1.
%

if (key in object)
%exp
The in operator matches all object keys, including those in the object's prototype chain.

It was standardized before ES6.
%

Math.PI
%exp
This is library which comes in hand when more complex calculations are needed.

It is supported since ES1.1.
%

void
%exp
A void function is a function that has no return values.

It was standardized before ES6.
%
