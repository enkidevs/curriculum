# Handling modules

---
## Content

Anything that is declared in a file in an `ES6` project isn't available outside of the said file. 

Use `export` to make it accessible. Here's how exporting a user class works:  

```
//user.js

var localVar = 123; // Invisible externally

export default function User(age){
	this.age = age;
}; // Can be imported by other files

```

Import the class in another file: 
```
//user_info.js

import User from 'user';
var newbie = new User(22);
```

## Revision

Import the `enki` class in another file :
```javascript
??? Enki ??? 'enki';
```
* import
* from
* to
* export
* default
* function
* require
