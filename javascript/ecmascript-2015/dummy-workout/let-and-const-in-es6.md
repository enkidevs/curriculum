# `let` and `const` in ES6

---
## Content

ES6 introduces `let` and `const`. You can use these to create variables that are **block-scoped**.

In ES5 `var` variables are **function-scoped**.

You can use `const` to create **constant**  variables:
```
'use strict'; // needed
const c = 'Enki';
c = 'Noki'; // Error
```

This does not mean the variable is *immutable*, just that it cannot be reassigned.

In a loop the `const` variable is created again in each iteration, so it can be given a different value each time.

You can use `let` to create **mutable** variables. If you declare a variable in a loop using `let`, you get a new binding for each iteration. This can be used in `for`, `for-in` and `for-of` loops:
```
for (let i=0; i < 3; i++) {
    ...
}

```

## Practice

`const` can be used to create ??? variables, whereas `let` can be used to create ??? variables. `const` and `let` can be used to create ???-scoped variables.

* immutable
* mutable
* block
