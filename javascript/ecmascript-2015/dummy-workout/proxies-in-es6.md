# Proxies in ES6

---
## Content

In ES6, you can redefine the semantics of some operations using **proxies**. 

Proxies are special objects, created with two parameters:

* **handler**: for each operation, there is a corresponding handler method (a **trap**) that intercepts the operation on its way to the target and performs that operation. 

* **target**: if the handler doesnâ€™t intercept the operation then the operation is performed on the target.

```
var target = {};
var handler = {
  get: function (receiver, name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
};

var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.world);
// Hello, world!
```
However, because the handler doesn't implement a trap **set**(setting properties) alongside **get** trap, the following property can be created for the `target`:
```
proxy.myProp = 'abc';
console.log(target.myProp);
// abc
```

ES6 also lets you create proxies that can be switched off (**revoked**):
```
let {proxy, revoke} =
    Proxy.revocable(target, handler);
// switch off by calling revoke()
```

Warning: proxies are an advanced ES6 feature, but are not yet implemented by many browsers or transpilers.

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to create a proxy which can be switched off:

```
let {proxy, ???} = 
    Proxy.???(target, handler);
```
* revoke
* revocable
* switchoff
* switch
* switchable
* turn_off
* end

## Revision

What two parameters does proxies have?

???


* handler & target
* target & host
* host & handler
* name & proxy
* proxy & function
* request & target
