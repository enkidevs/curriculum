# The `for-of` loop in ES6

---
## Content

The `for-of` loop is new in ES6:
```
 for (let x of iterable) {
   ···
 }
```
The loop iterates over `iterable` and assigns each of the enumerated items to the iteration variable `x`. `let` keeps the scope of `x` to within the loop.

You can convert data structures into iterable objects using the `entries()`, `keys()` and `values()` methods:
```
// entries() returns a [key,value] array
let a = ['E', 'n', 'k', 'i'];
for (let pair of a.entries()) {
  console.log(pair);
}
// [0, 'E']
// [1, 'n']
// [2, 'k']
// [3, 'i']
```

Note: you can use this loop on strings, but it loops over Unicode code points which may be represented by more than one character.

## Revision

Complete the syntax of `for-of` loop in **ES6**:
```javascript
??? (??? x ??? iterable) {
  x = x + 2;
  console.log(x);
}
```

* for
* let
* of
