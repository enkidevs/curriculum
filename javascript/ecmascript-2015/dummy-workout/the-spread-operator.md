# The `spread` operator

---
## Content

In ES5 you can pass arguments from a list or dynamic array to a function by using `.apply`:
```
console.log.apply(console, [1, 2, 3])
// 1 2 3
```
In ES6 the `spread` operator can be used instead. This is done by prepending three dots `...` to the array. You can use this operator alongside regular arguments.
```
console.log(1, ...[2, 3, 4], 5)
// 1 2 3 4 5
```
For example, this is useful in destructuring:
```
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = [3, 4, 5];
[a, b, ...c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

// ES6
console.log(1, ???[2, 3, 4], 5)
```
