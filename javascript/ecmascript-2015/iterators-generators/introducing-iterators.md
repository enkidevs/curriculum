# Introducing Iterators

---
## Content

An iterator is a special type of object that returns items from a sequence one at a time and remembers its position within the sequence.

A sequence can be anything but for simplicity let's imagine we have an array of numbers from 1 to 5:

```javascript
[1,2,3,4,5];
```

Whilst we could easily write a loop to iterate through these numbers let's write a function to return an iterator to do this.

```javascript
function getIterator(){
 var num = [1,2,3,4,5];
 var nextIndex = 0;

 return {
  next: function(){
   var x = num[nextIndex];
   nextIndex++;
   return {
    value: x
   }
  }
 };
}
```

What's going on here?

We have defined two variables - our sequence of numbers (num) and another (nextIndex) to keep track of our current position.

We then return an object with a next method that will retrieve a value at the current position, increment the position and return an object with our value in the value property.

We can use this iterator as follows:

```javascript
var it = getIterator();
it.next(); //Object {value: 1}
it.next(); //Object {value: 2}
it.next(); //Object {value: 3}
it.next(); //Object {value: 4}
it.next(); //Object {value: 5}
```

## Practice

Which of the following statements is false about iterators?

???

* Iterators work only on arrays
* Iterators are special objects that go over a collection
* Iterators can be manually implemented
* Iterators remember the position while iterating

## Revision

What method do iterators canonically make use of to advance the iteration?

???

* iterator.next()
* iterator.pop()
* iterator.get()
* iterator.advance()
* iterator.step()
