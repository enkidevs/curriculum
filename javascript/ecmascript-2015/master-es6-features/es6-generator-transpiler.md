# ES6 Generator Transpiler

---
## Content

Generators are a new syntax in ES6. Unlike other ES6 features (such as Promises), Generators cannot be simply polyfilled on top of ES5. 

If you need to make your JavaScript available to pre-ES6 browsers you can use a **transpiler** or **trans-compiler**.  

Transpilers take the ES6 syntax and transform it into pre-ES6 code with the same behaviour.

An example of this is the **regenerator** transpiler by facebook:
