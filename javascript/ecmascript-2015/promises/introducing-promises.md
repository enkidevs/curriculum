# Introducing Promises

---
## Content

A **promise** is an object that represents a value that may or may not be obtained in the future and can be passed around like any other object.

You may have come across promises in JavaScript before either in the language itself, libraries such as jQuery (which some would argue are not really promises) and libraries such as q or rsvp.

Some of these libraries conform (and add their own additional functionality as well) to a specification called **Promise/A+**. ES6 bases its promise implementation on this specification.

**Why use promises?**

It is common in JavaScript to perform tasks that do not complete immediately â€“ for example making an ajax call.

JavaScript only has one thread (ignoring web and service workers) to run in. Pages would run very slowly if we had to stop everything on a page to wait for an ajax call so JavaScript continues to execute other code.

However we still need a way to know when our ajax call has completed.

One way of approaching this problem is to use callback functions. A callback function is called when the original task has completed.

Callbacks work great for simple scenarios but with more complex scenarios things get complex and out of control quickly - for example when you need to handle more complex flow conditions such as multiple callbacks and exceptions.

A better approach is to use promises lets see how to do this next.

## Practice

Which of the following statements about promises do you consider false?

???

* Promises will block the execution thread of your application
* Promises tend to be more useful in complex scenarios where callback get out of control
* Promises were available before standard JavaScript implementation via third-party libraries
* Promises are used for asynchronous operations

## Revision

What problem do Promises try to solve?

???

* callbacks getting out of control in complex scenarios
* asynchronous calls stopping thread execution
* lack of any kind of support for asynchronous operation
* too many libraries doing the same thing
