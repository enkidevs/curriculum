Set is a new data structure in ES6 that will only store unique values.
 
```
var mySet = new Set();
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(1);
mySet.size; //size still 1
```

We can test if a set already has a value by using the has method:

```
mySet.has(1); //true
```

Note that iterating through a set will return objects in their insertion order.
