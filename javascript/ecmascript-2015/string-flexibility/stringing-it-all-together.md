Do you know how to manipulate Strings in ES6?

```
/* Make this
code print 'Hello Mary Sue!'*/
var firstName = 'Mary';
var surname = 'Sue';
console.log(`Hello ???!`);
```
* `${firstName} ${surname}`
* `"+firstName+" "+surname+"`
* `#firstName + #surname`
%exp
There are two ways of printing a variable's value. The first one is to wrap the variable in a string. The second one, the one used in this example, is called **expression interpolation**.
%

---

```
/* What is needed
 to prevent the new line \n? */
var comment =???`Not a newline: \n`;
alert(comment);
```
* `String.raw`
* `Template.ignore`
* `$.`
%exp
The raw string will include any escaped characters and backslashes that are present in the string.
%

---

```
/* Make the array
['e', 'n', 'k', 'i'] */
var arr = [???'enki'];
alert(arr);
```
* `...`
* `String.spread`
* `$.`
%exp
`...` is called spread operator in JavaScript. It is for use on **iterable** data types.

As the name implies what it actually does is break any **iterable** data types into its pieces.  
%

```
/* Make the console print:
e
n
k
i
*/
"use strict"
for (let c ??? 'enki') {
  console.log(c);
}
```
* `of`
* `in`
* `=`
%exp
The `for ... of` statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects.

It creates a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed on each step.
%

---
```
// Make this true
'thecowjumpedoverthemoon'.???('oo');
```
* `includes`
* `contains`
* `endsWith`
%exp
Using `includes` you can test if a substring is contained by a larger string or text.
%

---

```
/* Make the alert
'na na na na na '*/
alert('na '.???);
```
* `repeat(5)`
* `again(5)`
* `${5}`
%exp
The `repeat()` method creates and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string it was applied on.
