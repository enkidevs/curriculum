# Template Strings


---

## Content

ES6 introduces a new feature called template strings that make it easier to work with strings by adding string interpolation and multi-line strings:

```bash
let company = "Enki";
console.log(`Hello ${company}!`);
//prints: "Hello Enki!"
```

Template literals are denoted by the OÃÅ character, rather than `''` or `""`. When you use template strings, you can have multiline strings:

```bash
let aMultilineString = `
Hello
I am a multiline string
`
```

As well as embedding *any* JavaScript expression inside of a pair of curly braces prefixed by a dollar sign: `${5 + 5}`. The expression will be cast to a string, then replaced inside the template string.

```bash
let item = "Oranges";
let itemPrice = 2.50;
let money = 10;
let compositeString = `Hi,
I have ${money} dollars,
and I would like to purchase :
${itemPrice / money} ${item}s.
`

console.log(compositeString);
```

The above would output:

```bash
Hi,
I have 10 dollars,
and I would like to purchase :
4 Oranges.
```

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet to assemble a template string that says "Beam me up Scotty!"

```javascript
let what = "Beam" ;
let who = "Scotty";

let line = `??? me up ???!`;
```

* `${what}`
* `${who}`
* `#{who}`
* `%s`
* `$(who)`
* `#(who)`
* `#{what}`
* `%s`
* `$(what)`
* `#(what)`

## Revision

Complete the following code snippet to assemble a template string that says `"Stay Hungry Stay Foolish"`.

```javascript
let attr = "Hungry" ;
let attr2 = "Foolish";

let line = `Stay ??? Stay ???`;
```

* `${attr}`
* `${attr2}`
* `#{attr}`
* `%s`
* `$(attr)`
* `#(attr)`
* `#{attr2}`
* `%s`
* `$(attr2)`
* `#(attr2)`
