# Symbol

---
## Content

ES 6 introduces a new primitive type - **Symbol**.

Symbols are unique and immutable. These special characteristics give them a number of usages we will look at shortly.

But how do you work with symbols?

The following code creates a symbol:

```javascript
var sym = Symbol();
```

Be sure not to use the new operator when creating a symbol otherwise you will get an exception.

During creation you can also set a description for the symbol which is useful mainly for debugging purposes:

```javascript
var sym = Symbol("Enki");
console.log(sym)
// Symbol(Enki)
```

Note that supplying a description when creating a symbol does not add the symbol to the symbol registry which we will discuss shortly.

The typeof method of course returns symbol:

```javascript
typeof Symbol(); //"symbol"
```

When you create a symbol it is unique even if you create symbols with the same names:

```javascript
var sym1 = Symbol("Enki");
var sym2 = Symbol("Enki");
sym1 === sym2; //false
```

This probably is not what you would expect but remember Symbols are always unique.

If you want to be able to access the same symbol using a key, we can use the Symbol registry which we will discuss next.

## Practice

What will be the output of the following statements ?

```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol('enki')
console.log(sym1)
// ???

console.log(typeof sym1)
// ???

const sym2 = Symbol('enki')
console.log(sym1 === sym2)
// ???
```

* Symbol(enki)
* "symbol"
* false
* true
* error
* Enki
* "enki"
* Symbol("Enki")
* "number"
* "primitive"

## Revision

How do you create a `Symbol` in ES6?

```javascript
// a
const sym = new Symbol('enki')

// b
const sym = Symbol.create('enki')

// c
const sym = Symbol('enki')

// d
const sym = Symbol.new('enki')
```

???

* c
* a
* b
* d
