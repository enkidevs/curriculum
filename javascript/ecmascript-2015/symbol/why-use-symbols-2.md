Probably the primary use of symbols is to introduce changes into EcmaScript. We can this in action with *iterators*.

**Symbol.iterator** is used to identify something that can be iterated over. It is used by language features such as *for of* loops to understand how to work with an object.

Don't worry too much about what the below code does just understand we are using a special inbuilt (referred to as well known) symbol to access the iterator functionality:

```
let p = ["alex","bill","john"];
let it = p[Symbol.iterator]();
it.next().value; //alex
it.next().value; //bill
```

JavaScript contains many "well known symbols" that could not be accessed prior to ES6 such as **Symbol.iterator** and **Symbol.match**.

Note that you won’t find any well-known symbols in the symbol registry either:

```
Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.iterator);
//undefined
```

Symbols can also implement a kind of limited (they are still accessible via other means) privacy – let's discuss this next.
