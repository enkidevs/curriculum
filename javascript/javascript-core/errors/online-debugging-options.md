# Online Debugging Options


---

## Content

It can be useful to quickly test a bit of code without having to create HTML and JavaScript files.

One way to do this is to use an *online JavaScript environment*.

There are many options available but some of the better known sites are:

- codepen.io
- jsbin.com
- js.do
- jsfiddle.net
- pythontutor.com

As well as running JavaScript these sites often allow you to reference common external libraries such as jQuery, Angular and React which saves you from downloading and setting them up.

Online debugging options are also great for **sharing** code with others.

This can be very useful when you are posting a question on a forum site - you are much more likely to get a response if you can provide a running example of your issue.
