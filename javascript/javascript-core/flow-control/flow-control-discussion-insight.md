## Content

Now that you learned some JavaScript, it's time to apply it!

Let's say you are a farmer, and you need someone to count all the legs of your animals.

You remember that you learned JavaScript with Enki and that you can do this through coding.

How would you write a function that takes two inputs, the type of an animal and how many of those animals are at the farm, and returns the total number of legs?

For example, in our Enki farm, we count the number of legs for our cows like this:

```js
const animal = 'cow';
const numberOfAnimals = 10;

countLegs(animal, numberOfAnimals); // 40
```

It's up to you to choose what animals your farm has and how many of each you have.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`const name = 'Andrei'`)
- flow control (`if (name === 'Andrei') { ... }`)
- functions (`function sayHi() { ... }`)

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You could start by creating one variable for each animal. In there, you can store the number of animals your farm has.

Then, create a function and name it.

Now, using one of the flow control methods that you learned (e.g. `if` or `switch`), you can check the animal's type and find out their leg number.

Finally, sum all the legs and return the value.

Don't forget to call the function at the end.
