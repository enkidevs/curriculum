# Check If a Function Exists


---

## Content

There are certain scenarios where scripts are shared between different parts of a website. This can result in calling functions that *do not exist*. 

Here is how you can check if a `function` exists beforehand:

```javascript
if (typeof myFunction === "function") { 
    // safe to use the function
    myFunction();
}
```

## Practice

When can a scenario occur where calling functions do not exist? 

???

- When scripts are shared between different parts of a website.
- When functions haven't been declared properly.
- When scripts haven't been passed or imported properly.

## Revision

Complete the `if` statement to check if a function exists:

```javascript
if(??? myFunction === ???){
  myFunction();
}
```

- typeof
- "function"
- function
- !
- undefined
