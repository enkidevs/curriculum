You can think of every website as a car ðŸš—.

- The metal frame, the doors, the steering wheel: this is all HTML

- The paint: this is CSS.

- The engine, wiring, and everything under the hood: this is **JavaScript**.

It's what brings the web to life!



For example, here's code that makes sure a user is old enough to use your website: 
```js
let age = prompt("Please Enter Your Age")
if(age < 16) {
  alert("You are too young to sign up, sorry!")
}
```

Every time you refresh your Twitter feed or search for a pair of skinny jeans on Amazon, you interact with JavaScript.

It's the language of the Web; Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, etc., all use it for one purpose or another.

> ðŸ¤” What purpose will you use it for?
