JavaScript is Everywhere!

Every time you refresh your Twitter feed or search for a pair of skinny jeans on Amazon, you interact with JavaScript.

For instance, the following code shows an alert that you might be familiar with 👖:

```js
alert("Warning! 👖 no longer fit.");
```

JavaScript is essentially the language of the Web; Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, etc., all use it for one purpose or another.
