You can think of every website as a car.

The metal frame, the doors, the steering wheel: this is all HTML.

The paint: this is CSS.

The engine, wiring, and everything under the hood: this is JavaScript. 

JavaScript is Everywhere!

Every time you refresh your Twitter feed or search for a pair of skinny jeans on Amazon, you interact with JavaScript.

It's what brings the web to life!

Not only is JavaScript powerful enough to drive almost every web service you use, but it is also one of the more readable programming languages.

For example, here's code that makes sure a user is old enough to use your website: 
```js
let age = prompt("Please Enter Your Age")
if(age < 16) {
  alert("You are too young to sign up, sorry!")
}
```



JavaScript is essentially the language of the Web; Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, etc., all use it for one purpose or another.
