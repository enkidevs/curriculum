JavaScript is one of the most popular languages to learn. 

Here are a few reasons why:

We can use it to make fully functional websites (front-end and back-end), mobile apps, desktop apps, and even machine learning algorithms.

- **Active Community**
JavaScript has the largest programming community in the world[1]. Any problem you face, chances are someone has already published a solution online. 

- **High Demand**
JavaScript developers are needed by small and large companies. The average salary for Node.js[2] developers in the US is about $[106,121](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-nodejs-salary-SRCH_KO0,24.htm).
