# Types - Boolean and Number


---

## Content

### Boolean

The Boolean type has two options: `true` or `false` (these are specified as lower case):

```javascript
let isCold = true;
let isHot = false;
```

### Number

JavaScript supports both whole and decimal numbers all using the same number type:

```javascript
let numberOfMonths = 12;
let temperature = 17.2;
```

You can perform simple maths calculations using the following operators:

```javascript
1 + 2; // add
9 / 3; // divide
1 * 5; // multiply
9 - 5; // subtract
10 % 4; // modulus (division remainder)
```

More math functionality is available via the `Math` object e.g.

```javascript
Math.round(5.7); // 6
```

## Practice

On the first line declare a **boolean variable** named `a` that's `true`.
On the second line declare a **number constant** named `b` with the value equal to `3.14`.

```javascript
let ??? = ???
??? ??? = ???
```

- `a`
- `true`
- `const`
- `b`
- `3.14`
- `"3.14"`
- `True`
- `"true"`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `'3.14'`
- `'true'`
