## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using the `person` object, your tasks are to:
- **add `"German"` to the array of `languages`**
- **replace the `equation` with `"e = mc^2"`**
- **add a new key called `"nobelRecipient"` with the value `true`**
- **delete the `quote` key**
- **log the new `person` object to the console**

Here's how the `person` object looks like:
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Albert Einstein",
  profession: "Theoretical physicist",
  languages: ["Italian", "English"],
  equation: "c^2 = a^2 + b^2",
  quote: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving."
};
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- object methods (`.push()`, `delete`)

[1: Hints]

Use the built-in methods to `delete` the `quote` and to add the new language.
