# Weekend & Weekday Switch

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to:
> - **create a switch statement with seven cases (for each day of the week)**
> - **each case can be represented as a number from 0-6 or a string**
> - **add a default case**
> - **each case should output something**

Example input output:
```javascript
// Input
2

// Output
// It is Wednesday my dudes!
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`switch`)
- output (`console.log()`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a variable that will hold your input value. 

The `switch` statement should have a separate `case` for every day of the week.

Don't forget to `break` out of each case.
