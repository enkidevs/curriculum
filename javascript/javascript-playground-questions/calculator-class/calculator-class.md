## Content

Can you create a `Calculator` class that has the ability to multiply, divide, subtract and add two numbers?

After creating the class, call each of the four methods to confirm it works.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- class creation (`class Something { }`)
- method definition (`something(x) {}`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

A class in JavaScript is defined like this:

```javascript
class Name {
  method() { /* does stuff */ }
}
```

The name for your class should be `Calculator` and it should have 4 methods for each arithmetic operation.
