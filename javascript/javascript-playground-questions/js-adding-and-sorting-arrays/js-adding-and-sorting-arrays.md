# Adding & Sorting Two Arrays

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **create a function that joins two arrays and sorts the resulting array in ascending order**.

Use these two arrays:
```javascript
let oddNumbers = [101, 23, 11, 37, 3, 83, 1];
let evenNumbers = [12, 0, 8, 92, 98, 44, 76];
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- array functions (`concat`, `sort`, ...)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You can concatenate the two arrays into a third one and then sort them.

> 💡 The `sort` method by default compares values as strings. This means that `101` comes before `2`. To fix this, pass in your own comparison function that returns the difference between the given numbers. 

Don't forget to print the resulting array.
