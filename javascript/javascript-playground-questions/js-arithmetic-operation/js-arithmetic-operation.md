> 👩‍💻 Your task is to **create a program that uses at least one of the arithmetic operators and outputs the result**. 

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`)
