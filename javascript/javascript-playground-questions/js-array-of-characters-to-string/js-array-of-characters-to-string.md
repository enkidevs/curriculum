# Array of Character to a String

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to **create a program that joins an array of characters into a string and outputs the result**.

Sample array of characters to use:
```javascript
let c = [
  'h', 
  'e', 
  'l', 
  'l', 
  'o', 
  ' ', 
  'w', 
  'o', 
  'r', 
  'l', 
  'd'
];
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function declaration (`function something(x) { ... }`)
- flow control (`for...of`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

[1: Hints]

Create an empty string and use a `for...of` loop to go through every character of the array, concatenating each character to the empty string.
