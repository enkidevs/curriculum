> 👩‍💻 Using the `numbers` array, your task is to write a program that **outputs the first and last value, second and second to last, and so on**.


Sample array:
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2];
```

Sample output:
```javascript
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
[5, 6]
[7, 8]
[9, 10]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`while..`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You only need to loop through half of the array.

To get the values in each loop cycle, take the loop counter index from the left and right sides of the array.

For example, the 4th element from left and right of `myArray` are:
```javascript
let left = myArray[3];
let right = myArray[myArray.length - 1 - 3];
```
