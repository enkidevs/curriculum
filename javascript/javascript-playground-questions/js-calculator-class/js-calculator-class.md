To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- class creation (`class Something { }`)
- method definition (`something(x) {}`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

A class in JavaScript is defined like this:

```javascript
class Name {
  method() { /* does stuff */ }
}
```

The name for your class should be `Calculator` and it should have four methods for each arithmetic operation.
