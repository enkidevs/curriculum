## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **checks if a number is even or odd and outputs a message for both cases.** 

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, %, ...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
