## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **outputs the first 15 terms of the Fibonacci sequence**.

> The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- first two terms of the sequence are `1` and `1`.
- flow control (`while..`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

For this problem you will need two variables to hold your numbers, a counter variable, and a temporary variable.

The temporary variable goes inside the loop while the counter increases at the end of every loop cycle.
