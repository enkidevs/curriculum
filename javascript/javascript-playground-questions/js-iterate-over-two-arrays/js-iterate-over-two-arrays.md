# Iterate Over two Arrays

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **iterates over two arrays simultaneously and outputs a value from each array as a pair**.

Sample arrays:

```javascript
let names = ['Stefan', 'Michael', 'Rebekah', "Natasha"];
let lastNames = ['Stojanovic', 'Stevens', 'Mikaelson', "Romanoff"];
```

Sample output:
```plain-text
Stefan Stojanovic
Michael Stevens
....
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of`)

[1: Hints]

Create the arrays and use a loop to cycle through them. 

> Use the same index to track the second array as well.
