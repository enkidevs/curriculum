# Miles to Kilometers Converter

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **converts miles to kilometers and outputs the result**.

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`)
- A kilometer is equal to `0.621371` miles
- A mile is equal to `1.60934` kilometers

As a bonus, see how you would round the result up to 2 decimal places.

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use one variable to hold the number of miles, another to hold the conversion factor, and a third one to hold the result.

Example input / output:
```plain-text
// Input
3 miles

// Output
3 miles are equal to 4.8280 kilometers
```
