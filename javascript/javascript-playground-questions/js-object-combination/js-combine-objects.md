## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a function that **combines two objects and returns a single one**

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 33`).
- function declaration (`function something(x) { ... }`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining your function with your choice of name. It should take two objects as input.

Inside the function, you can add one object to another using `Object.assign()` or object spread operator `...`.

Here's one way:

```javascript
let o1 = { name: 'enki' };
let o2 = { isFun: true };
let combined = { ...o1, ...o2 };
```

Outside of the function create the two objects.

Call your function with the two objects inside a `console.log` statement.
