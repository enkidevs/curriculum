Here is a gif from Wikipedia that demonstrates how each value is calculated:

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 22`)
- flow control (`for...of:`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

The left-most and right-most values of every row are `1`.

Every line has a number of integers equal to the line number.

The first two rows have only `1`s.

The values between the left and right bound of every row are equal to the sum of values just above them.

Use nested loops.
