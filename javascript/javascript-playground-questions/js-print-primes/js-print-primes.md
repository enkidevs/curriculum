> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **outputs the first 15 prime numbers.**

> A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ...

2 is only divisible by 1 and itself, making it prime. 4 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, and itself.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30)...`, `for...of`)

> 💡 One way to test if a number is prime is to check if it's divisible by any number from 2 up to (rounded) half of itself. For example, to test if 31 is prime, we check if it's divisible by any number from 2 up to 15.

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

First, create a `for` loop that will range from 2 to 50. 

Inside the loop, add an `if` statement to check if the counter is prime by calling the `isPrime` function and then print its value if the result is true.

The `isPrime` function will perform the primality test mentioned in the insight.

Here's one example of its implementation:

```javascript
function isPrime(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i <= n / 2; i += 1) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```
