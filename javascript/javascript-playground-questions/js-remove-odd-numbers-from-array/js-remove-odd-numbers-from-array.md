# Remove Odd Numbers From an Array

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **removes all odd numbers from an array and returns the result.**

Example array to use:
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of`, `if (x > 1)...`)
- Array methods (`map()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You need two arrays. The first one is already created; `numbers`. The second one is empty and will hold the odd numbers.

Use a loop to cycle through and a conditional statement to check whether a number is odd and add it to the second array if it is.
