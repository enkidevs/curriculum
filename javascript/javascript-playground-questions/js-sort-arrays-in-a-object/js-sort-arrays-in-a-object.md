# Sort Arrays in an Object

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using the `numberedArrays` object, your task is to create a program that **sorts the values in each array in ascending order and outputs the resulting object.**

Example object:

```javascript
let numberedArrays = {
  'first': [7, 1, 5, 3],
  'second': [4, 8, 2, 6],
  'third': [8, 1, 19, 13]
};
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- Array method (`sort()`)
- flow control (`for...of:`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating the object.

Use a `for...of` loop to go through the object.

Next, inside the loop, sort the current values of the object arrays:

`obj[key].sort()`

Finally, outside of the loop, add a print to output the sorted result.
