# Breaking a Loop

---

## Content
  
> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that:
> - **loops through an array of names**
> - **outputs every name until it reaches a specific one, then breaks out of the loop**

Example array to use:

```javascript
let scientists = [
  "Niels Bohr",
  "Galileo Galilei", 
  "Marie Curie", 
  "Albert Einstein", 
  "Rosalind Franklin", 
  "Katherine Johnson", 
  "Lise Meitner", 
  "Nikola Tesla"
  ];
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- loops (`for x in y:...`)
- flow-altering statements (`break`, `continue`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use a loop to cycle through and `print` every name. 

When you reach the specified name, `break` out of the loop.
