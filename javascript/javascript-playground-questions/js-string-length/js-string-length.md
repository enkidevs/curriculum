## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to make a program that will **count the total number of letters in a sentence (excluding spaces) and output the result**.

```javascript
// Input string
"Elon Musk"

// Output count
8
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30)`, `for...of`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two variables; one for the string and the other as a counter.

Use a loop to go through each character of the sentence. Increase the `counter` if the character is not a space.
