# Sum Object Items

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **takes an object with at least five numerical values, sums them, and outputs the result**.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 31`)
- function declaration (`function(x)`)
- Object global methods (`values()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating an object whose values are numbers.

Then define a function that takes any object as input.

Inside the function return the sum of the objects values.

Finally, call the function with the previously created object.
