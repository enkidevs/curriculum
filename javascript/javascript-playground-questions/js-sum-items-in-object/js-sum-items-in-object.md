# Sum Object Items

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **takes an object with at least five values as input**
> - **sums all of the values**
> - **outputs the result**

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 31`)
- function declaration (`function(x)`)
- Object global methods (`values()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating an object whose values are numbers.

Then define a function that takes any object as input.

Inside the function return the sum of the objects values.

Finally, call the function with the previously created object.
