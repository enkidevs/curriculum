## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a function that **splits a sentence into separate words and only outputs words longer than four letters**.

Example input/output:
```javascript
// Input
myFunction('Mary had a little lamb')

// Output
little
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of...`, `if (x > 4)...`)
- array functions (`split()`)
- array property (`length`)
- function declaration (`function something(x) { ... }`)

As a bonus, try combining the array functions `split()` and `filter()` to solve the problem.  

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a function with an input variable. 

> Use (`.split()`).

Use a loop to cycle through every word and a conditional statement to only output words longer than four letters.
