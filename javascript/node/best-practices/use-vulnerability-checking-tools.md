# Use Vulnerability Checking Tools


---

## Content

Medium and large applications usually have an impressive number of dependencies. The latest `npm i` for the Enki repository installed over 2,800 packages - direct dependencies and their dependencies as well.

In order for the code not to break in production, dependencies also have to be frozen to a specific version that works for sure (`shrinkwrap`) and updated manually. But as you can imagine, the chain of dependencies might be the cause for a lot of trouble: old, insecure versions of packages might find their way into your `package.json`. You don't even have to use it yourself, it can be needed by another package.

Because it is hard to check everything manually, wouldn't it be nice to have an automated tool that does just that? It's called `nsp`, Node Security Platform, and it checks your `package.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` for vulnerabilities.

Install and run it with:

```bash
$ npm install nsp --global
$ cd path/to/project && nsp check
```

There is also the task runner version for both `gulp` and `grunt` so you can add it to your CI service:

```bash
$ npm install gulp-nsp --save-dev
$ npm install grunt-nsp --save-dev
```

To check your code against insecure coding patterns, try the `nsp` ESlint plugin:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev
    eslint-plugin-security
```

Then add it as a plugin in your `.eslintrc` file.

## Practice

If you are using `npm`, where can you usually find the frozen versions of your packages?

???

* npm-shrinkwrap.json
* yarn-shrinkwrap.json
* package.json
* frozen-package.json


---

## Revision

Do you remember what is tested by `nsp`'s ESlint plugin?

???

* insecure coding patterns
* stack overflows
* static typing
* typos
