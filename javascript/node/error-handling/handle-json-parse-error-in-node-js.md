# Handle 

`JSON.parse`

 error in Node.js


---

## Content

Handling a `JSON.parse` error is one of the few situations when you'd use a `try/catch` in Node.

This is because **synchronous operational errors** are very rare in Node and only occur due to bad user input. `JSON.parse` is a synchronous function and you have to deliver the error synchronously.

For example:

```bash
webSocket.on('msg', function (msg) {
  var msgObj;
  try {
    msgObj = JSON.parse(msg);
  } catch (e) {
    return console.error(e);
  }
}
```
