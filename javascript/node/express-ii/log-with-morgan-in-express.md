# Log with `morgan` in **Express**

---
## Content

To use the new **HTTP** logger (called `morgan`) from **Express 4.0** you need to install:

```bash
npm install morgan
```

And import it:

```javascript
var morgan = require('morgan');
```

When creating a new `morgan` logger middleware a `format` must be specified, followed by desired `options` (which are optional) :

```javascript
app.use(morgan('tiny'));
```

The `format` can be a string or a function that will produce a log entry (tokens are of help here). Predefined names include `dev`, `combined`, `short` etc.

Options worth mentioning are:

- `immediate` that will write log lines on request instead of response (requests will be logged even when server has crashed)
- `skip` that determines when logging should be skipped.

To only log error responses:

```javascript
morgan('combined', {
  skip: function (req, res) {
    return res.statusCode < 400 }
});
```

Custom `token`s can be also defined using `morgan.token` function.

## Practice

Which are the two parameters allowed in the `morgan` constructor?

```javascript
const morgan = require('morgan')

// ...
app.use(morgan(???, ???))
```

* format
* options
* name
* string
* etc
* expressVersion
* version

## Revision

Use `morgan` logger in express with `tiny` format:

```javascript
app.???(???('tiny'));
```

* use
* morgan
* skip
* immediate
* express
* install
* make
* logger
