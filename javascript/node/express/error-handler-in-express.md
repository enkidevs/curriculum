# Error handler in **Express**

---
## Content

The **Express 4.0** `errorhandler` module is designed as a **development only** error handling middleware. This is because all information passed through this module is also sent back to the client.

Installing the API:
```bash
$ npm install errorhandler
```
Importing the API:
```javascript
var errorHandler = require('errorhandler');
```
Whenever an object is provided to **Express** as an error, the `errorhandler` module will print as much as possible about the error, using content negotiation between **HTML**, **JSON** and plain text.

The constructor can, but is not obliged, to take `log` as an argument. This can take the values `true`, `false` or a function that will handle the errors.
```javascript
app.use(errorhandler({
  log: errorNotification});
function errorNotification(err,str,req) {
  ...
}
```
Passing `true` to the log will log errors using `console.error(str)`.
