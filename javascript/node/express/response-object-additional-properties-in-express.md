# response object additional properties in **Express**

---
## Content

**Express** framework adds many useful properties or methods to the `response` object.

This object is usually passed to a callback (therefore it can take any name) and starts its life as an instance of `http.ServerObject`, a core **Node** object.

Send a response to the client:

```javascript
res.send(body);
res.send(status,body);
//default content type is "text/html"
```

Send **JSON** to the client:

```javascript
res.json(json);
res.json(status, json);
```

Send different content depending on the Accept request header:

```javascript
res.format({'text/plain': 'hey',
  'text/html': '<b>hey</b>'});
```

Using `res.locals` one can get an object containing the default context for rendering views.  Rendering a view using the configured templating engine can be done using:

```javascript
res.render(view,[locals],callback);
```

If middleware support is present, client cookies can be set/cleared:

```javascript
res.cookie(name,value,[options]);
res.clearCookie(name,[options]);
```

## Practice

Consider the response object proposed by the Express library.

How would you clear the cookie `my-rogue-cookie`?

```javascript
res.???(???)
```

If an error happened we would like to send a "There is an error" message to the client. Implement this, together with a **503** status code in the following snippet:

```javascript
res.???(???, ???)
```

* clearCookie
* 'my-rogue-cookie'
* send
* 'There is an error'
* 503
* 404
* eraseCookie
* emptyCookie
* cookie
* myRogueCookie
* back
* respond
* error

## Revision

Send the given JSON file back to the client user Express's `response` object:

```javascript
var myJson; // equal to json we want to send
//...
res.???(???);
```

* json
* myJson
* status
* send
* format
* render
* cookie
* toJSON
* sendJSON
