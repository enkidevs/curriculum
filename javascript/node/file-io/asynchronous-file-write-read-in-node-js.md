# Asynchronous File Write/Read in Node.js


---

## Content

The *File System* (**FS**) module provides file **I/O**. The methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms.

The last parameter of asynchronous methods will be a **callback function**. This function should have as the first parameter an **error**.

It is preferred to use asynchronous method over synchronous method as the formers never block program execution.

Write data to file:

```javascript
fs.writeFile(file, data[,options], callback)
```

`data` can be a string or a buffer. Options include `encoding` (default **utf8**), `flag` and `mode`.

Read data from file:

```javascript
fs.readFile(file[, options], callback)
```

Options include `encoding` and `flag`.

The **callback** can be defined as a function : `function (err, data)` where `data` is the actual data from the file.
