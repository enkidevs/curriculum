# Synchronous File Write/Read in Node.js


---

## Content

The File System (FS) module provides file I/O. The methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms.

When using the synchronous form any exceptions are immediately thrown. It is only recommended to use this form during program startup.

Use `fs.writeFileSync`  to **write data to a file**:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

fs.writeFileSync(file, data[, options])
```

This is the same syntax as `fs.writeFile` but it is synchronous and returns undefined rather than a callback function.

```javascript
fs.readFileSync(file[, options])
```

Use `fs.readFileSync` to **return the contents of a file**:

```javascript
// suppose file.txt
const fileContent =
  fs.readFileSync('./file.txt')
```

This is the synchronous version of `fs.readFile`. It returns a string or a buffer.

## Practice

Import the necessary module and fill in the gaps to read `file.txt` synchronously:

```javascript
const fs = ???

???.???('file.txt')
```

* require('fs')
* fs
* readFileSync
* fileReader
* file
* FileReader
* readFile
* readFileAsync
* readFileTxt

## Revision

Which method of `fs` can be used to write from a file in a synchronous fashion?

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

fs.???(file, data)
```

* writeFileSync
* writeSyncFile
* writeSync
* write
* writeFileAsync
* writeFile
