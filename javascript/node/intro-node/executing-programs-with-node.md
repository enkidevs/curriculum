# Executing Programs With Node


---

## Content

The Node.js interpreter can be used to execute JavaScript files and programs in the terminal. First, create a JavaScript file:

```javascript
/* main.js */
console.log('Node.js with Enki!');
```

To run any JavaScript program using Node use the following generic command:

```bash
node filename.js
# filename.js will be run
```

In this case, to run the *main.js* file the following command would be used:

```bash
node main.js
# that outputs:
Node.js with Enki!
```


---

## Practice

Consider the file `enki.js`:

```javascript
// enki.js
console.log('Hello, Enki!')
```

How would you run from the terminal interface the code in the file, using the NodeJS interpreter:

```bash
??? ???
# Hello, Enki!
```

- node
- enki.js
- enki
- nodejs
- npm
- run
- code
- enkijs
