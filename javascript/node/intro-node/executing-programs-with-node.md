# Executing programs with Node


---

## Content

The Node.js interpreter can be used to execute JavaScript files and programs in the terminal. First, create a JavaScript file:

```javascript
/* main.js */
console.log('Node.js with Enki!');
```

To run any JavaScript program using Node use the following generic command:

```bash
$ node filename.js
# filename.js will be ran
```

In this case, to run the *main.js* file the following command would be used:

```bash
$ node main.js
# that outputs:
Node.js with Enki!
```

## Practice

Consider the file `enki.js`:

```javascript
// enki.js
console.log('Hello, Enki!')
```

How would you run from the terminal interface the code in the file, using the NodeJS interpreter:

```bash
$ ??? ???
# Hello, Enki!
```

* node
* enki.js
* enki
* nodejs
* npm
* run
* code
* enkijs

## Revision

How would you run the code existing within `main.js`

```bash
$ ??? main.js
# main.js is ran
```

* node
* run
* compile
* code
* js
* javascript
* java
* nodeJS
