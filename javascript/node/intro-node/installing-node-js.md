# Installing Node.js


---

## Content

To setup a local environment to use Node.js both a text editor and the Node.js binary installables are required. JavaScript files can be created in any text editor (Notepad, Atom, Sublime) as long as the file has the extension `.js`. However, it’s recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Webstorm which is a far more useful tool when programming.

The latest version of Node is available to download from the Node website, once this has been downloaded and extracted, Node can be tested to ensure it’s working by running `node` from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
node
>
```

You should see a `>` appearing under the `node` command. This means your installation was successful! You are now using the `REPL` terminal which we will explore in-depth in the next insight.
