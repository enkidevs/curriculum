## Content

NPM is the package manager for JavaScript’s Node.js environment. It allows packages of code, modules, from developers across the world to be found, shared and implemented into your own systems.

The NPM registry is home to over 350,000 packages of code open for use to anyone who requires them and is used by over 4 million developers every month.

NPM comes installed with Node.js, however it is updated more often than Node. To check you’re using the latest NPM version run the following command from your terminal:

``` bash
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

To download and install a package from NPM:

```bash
$ npm install <package>
```
