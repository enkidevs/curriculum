## Content

In Node.js a local module is a module created locally to your application. A local module can include different functionalities of the application across different files and folders.

Local modules must be in their own separate JavaScript file.
Consider the following example of a local module (filename `news.js`):

```
var news = {
  good: function(good) {
    console.log('Good news! ' + good);
  },
  bad: function(bad) {
    console.log('Bad news... ' + bad);
  }
};
module.export = news
```

A local module has to be required into an application in the same way a core module does, the only difference being that the path to the module must be specified as follows in `main.js`:

```
var newsModule = require(`./news.js`);
```

The local module object can now be called with one of its functions:
```
newsModule.good('We're working on Node!');
```
To run the module:
```
$ node main.js
```
Which gives the following output:
```
Good news! We're working on Node!
```
