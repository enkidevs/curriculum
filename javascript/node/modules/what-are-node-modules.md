# What are Node Modules?


---

## Content

A module encapsulates an amount of code into one single code unit. Node has a module system implemented which allows for other JavaScript files to be included and used in your application. A substantial amount of Nodeâ€™s core functionality was implemented using JavaScript modules.

Node incorporates 3 different module types, modules can either be core modules, local modules or third party modules. An example of a core Node module is the `http` module. Local modules are Node.js files in your project that have an `exports` object declared. Third party modules usually have a `package.json` and are installed from a remote host into your `node_modules/` folder.

Using modules when building Node applications give a number of advantages:

* easy and straightforward inclusion of external libraries
* increased modularity
* reduced amount of code per file
* easier to read and maintain code
