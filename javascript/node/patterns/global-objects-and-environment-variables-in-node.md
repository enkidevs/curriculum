## Content

**Node** provides a set of useful objects and environment variables.

Get the directory of the current running script
(in `User/MyUser/Desktop`):
```javascript
console.log(__dirname);
// will log User/MyUser/Desktop
```

Get the path of the code being executed:
```javascript
console.log(__filename);
// will log User/MyUser/Desktop/script.js
```
This object is not necessarily global, but is local to each module.

Get command line arguments:
```javascript
console.log(process.argv);
```
Here `process` is a global object, `process.argv` will generate an array containing the command line arguments starting from index `2` (third element in the array) as the first two represent the path to **Node** application and the path to the current file.

Get the user environment:
```javascript
console.log(process.env);
```

Get current platform:
```javascript
console.log(process.platform);
```
