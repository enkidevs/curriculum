## Content

When you handle errors in Node.js, it is best practice to use the standard `Error` class.

You should also use the **conventional property names** to stay consistent with Node core and Node add-ons.

You should include any properties that are useful for the person who will read it. The caller might want to create a custom error message from the details provided.

For example:

* `localHostname` the local DNS hostname
* `localIp` the local IP address
* `localPort`the local TCP port
* `propertyName` an object property name, or an argument name
* `propertyValue` an object property value
