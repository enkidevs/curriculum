# Manage Child Processes in Node


---

## Content

**Node** has the ability to externalize *CPU-intensive* processing in order to free the event loop by *spawning* child processes that can communicate seamlessly with their parents.

The `child_process` module is required for any operation of this sort:

```javascript
let child = require('child_process');
```

The `exec(command, callback)` can be used to to run **UNIX** commands:

```javascript
child.exec("ls", function(
  err,
  stdout,
  stderr
) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  console.log(stdout);
});
```

This method does not provide any means of communicating with the parent and gives a buffered output. The `spawn()` method is an improved version of the first:

```javascript
let spawn = require("child_process").spawn;

// Create a child process
let child = spawn("tail", [
  "-f",
  "/var/log/system.log"
]);
// "tail" command is run in the argument
```

Listeners to `stdout` and `stderr` streams can be added:

```javascript
child.stdout.on("data", function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

## Practice

Complete the JS code snippet to create a child process:

```javascript
let spawn =
  require('???').???;
```

- child_process
- spawn
- create-child
- create
- new
- new-process
