## Content

The *Cluster* module allows you to identify the master process as follows:
```javascript
if(cluster.isMaster) { ... }
```
The master process is the process which a user initiates, there is only one master process. The master  process then initiates worker processes using the `fork()` method as follows:
```javascript
cluster.fork();
```
There can be as many or as few worker processes as required, all sharing the same server port handling incoming requests to the server.

A *Worker* object contains all the worker's public information and methods.

In the master this can be obtained using the command `cluster.workers`. In a worker this can be obtained using `cluster.worker`.

```

* Identifies the master process.
* Sets the master process.
* Sets the master process to null.

## Revision

Which method is used by the master process to initiate new worker processes? ???

* `cluster.fork();`
* `master.fork();`
* `cluster.new();`
* `master.new();`
* `cluster.process();`
* `master.process();`
