## Content

Avoiding command injection is highly recommended when the **security** factor of your Node application is taken into consideration.

Take the following example:
```javascript
child_process.exec('ls', function(err,data){
  console.log(data);
});
```
The problem is that `child_process.exec` makes a call to execute `/bin/sh`, meaning that it is a *bash interpreter* and not a program launcher.

When the user input is passed to the method - can be either *a backtick*  or `$()`, hence a new command can be injected by the attacker.

The simple way to avoid this threat is by using `child_process.execFile` or `child_process.spawn`.

## Practice

Which method should be used in the following case to retrieve a list of files chosen by a user?

```
var path = "user input";
child_process.???('ls', ['-l'
, path], function (err, data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

* `execFile`
* `exec`
* `spawn`
