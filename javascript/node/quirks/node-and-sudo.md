## Content

```bash
$ sudo node myapp.js
```

You should never do this. Most people that embrace running Node with superuser rights do it with the intention of allowing their **HTTP** server `listen()` on either port `80` or `443`.

If a bug or an error occurs in your application process it can **bring the whole system down** because it has all the credentials to do **anything**.

The most usual workaround for this is to set up a **HTTP server** / **proxy** to forward the request. This can be easily done with `nginx`, `Apache` or other tools.

Another workaround in Linux is to use the `libcap2-bin` package:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
$ sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep
/path/to/node

```
