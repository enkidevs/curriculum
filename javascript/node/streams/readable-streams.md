# Readable Streams

---
## Content

A readable stream reads data from a source. A source could be a file on a system, another stream, an array or buffer in memory or a variety of other options. Streams are `EventEmitters`, therefore they emit a number of events whilst running.

The most efficient way of reading data from a stream is to add a *listener* to the *data* event and attach a callback. When data is available to be read, the (readable) stream will emit a data event causing the callback to run, for example:

```javascript
let fs = require("fs");
let rstream = fs.createReadStream(
  "file.txt"
);
let data = "";

rstream.on("data", function (avail) {
  data += avail;
});
```
Calling `fs.createReadStream` creates a readable stream, this stream then begins to flow once a callback has been attached.

A callback also needs to be added for when the stream has reached the end of the data:

```javascript
rstream.on("end", function () {
  console.log(data);
});
```

Encoding can be set on the stream like follows:

```javascript
rstream.setEncoding(‘utf8’);
```
