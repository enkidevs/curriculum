## Content

Streams are unix pipes[1] allowing data to be read from a source and for data to be piped to a destination. A stream is effectively an `EventEmitter` with implementation of some special methods.

These special methods define whether a stream is Readable, Writable, or Duplex (readable and writable). Readable streams allow for data to be read from a source and writable streams allow for data to be written to a destination.

An example use of a Node stream is in a Node based HTTP server, `request` would be a readable stream, and `response` a writable stream. The filesystem, `fs`, module allows readable and writable streams to be implemented.

[1:unix pipes]
A `pipe` is a form of redirection that is used in **Linux** and other **Unix**-like operating systems to send the *output* of one program to another program for further processing (as *input*).
