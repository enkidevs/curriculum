# Bulk-Write in 

**Node**

 with 

`cork()`


---

## Content

Bulk writing/buffering on *writeable* streams is possible in **Node**.
Using the `cork()`  and `uncork()` API calls, one can specify a range where bulk writes will occur.

```bash
writable.cork()
```

Using the `cork()` method, the end user modifies the behaviour of writeable streams to buffering. Consequently, streams should accept new writes as long as it does not exceed the `highWaterMark` option passed to `Writable()`.

```bash
writable.uncork()
```

`uncork()` resets the behaviour and attempts to bulk-write all buffered writes to the underlying resource.

Flushing of buffered data can be also achieved by calling the `.end()` method.

## Practice

Which two API calls can be used to specify a range of where bulk writes will occur?

???

* `cork()` and `uncork()`
* `write()` and `end()`
* `writable()` and `unwritable()`


---

## Revision

What method is used to flush all buffered data from a stream?

???

* end()
* uncork()
* cork()
