# How to debug Node.js


---

## Content

ÃŸ
There are many options when debugging Node applications.

### Built-in debugger

Debug by putting a `debugger` statement in your code.
Run by:

```bash
node debug app.js
```

### Browser interface

More sophisticated debugging can be done using **Node Inspector**, which allows debugging via an interface inside of a browser.
Run by:

```bash
npm install -g node-inspector
node-debug app.js
```

### REPL

**Iron Node** also has sophisticated debugging for Linux, Windows and OS X.

```bash
npm install iron-node -g;
iron-node app.js
```
