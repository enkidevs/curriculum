# Http Server in **Node**

---
## Content

Create a `http` server with Node:
```javascript
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res){
    res.end('Hello Node', 200);
    console.log('Request made');
}).listen(8000);
```

Going to `http://localhost:8000`, the text specified in the program should appear!

To do this the `http` module is needed:
```javascript
var http = require('http');
```
The server was created (`createServer`) with a callback function as an argument. This function has 2 parameters (`req` - request and `res`- response) and acts like a gate to the application, handling all incoming *requests* accordingly.

The port on which it should listen was also specified: `.listen(8000)`.

## Practice

Which method is used to declare a new server with what arguments?

```javascript
var http = require(‘http’);
http.???(
    function(req, ???){
     //...
 }).listen(port);
```

* createServer
* res
* req
* newServer
* declareServer
* server
* env
* arg

## Revision

Create a `http` server and make it listen to port `8080`:
```javascript
var http = require('http');

http.???(function(req, res) {
  //
}).???(8080);
```


* createServer
* listen
* httpServer
* on
* localhost
* require
