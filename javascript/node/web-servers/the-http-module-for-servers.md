## Content

Node is well suited and frequently used for creating servers which are both lightweight and can handle multiple requests simultaneously. It comes out-of-the-box with the `http` module providing an intuitive, yet powerful API for this purpose.

To build the server, first require the `http` module into your JavaScript file:
```
var http = require(‘http’);
```
As all HTTP communication is done via the request / response pair, Node's `http` module uses the same concept, being designed to work with a `request` and a `response` object.

Next, a handler function needs to be defined to handle and respond to all requests accordingly:
```
function requestHandler(request, response) {

  response.end(‘Test response!’);

}
```

In the function above, the `.end()` method will `write` the specified content to the `response` and signal the server it was sent. This method **must** be called on each response.

To create the server a new HTTP server object needs to be created with a port number passed to it for it to listen on. First create the server via `createServer`:
```
var server = http.createServer
                  (requestHandler);
```
Then assign a port to the server object using `listen`:
```
server.listen(8000, function() {

  console.log(‘Server listening here:
              http://localhost:%s’, 8000);

});
```

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to listen for requests on port `2242` with `server`:
```
server.???(???, function() {

  console.log(‘Server listening here:
              http://localhost:%s’, 2242);

});

```

* `listen`
* `2242`
* `'listener'`
* `on`
* `createServer`
