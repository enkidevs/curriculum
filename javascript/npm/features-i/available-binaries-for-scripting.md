## Content

Scripting is great for compiling and processing. However, not all the modules you have installed can be used for scripting: binaries are required for the packages to be invoked from the command line.

Linters, precompilers and testing frameworks are examples of packages that should provide such a binary file. All of the available commands are commonly located inside the *node_modules/.bin/* directory.

You can check the exact location by running:
```bash
$ npm bin
/home/user/project/node_modules/.bin
```
Add an extra `-g` flag (`--global`) to check where global packages are installed:
```bash
$ npm bin
/usr/local/bin
```
There isn't a predefined command for listing the available binaries, but you can manually do it using *ls*:
```bash
$ ls node_modules/.bin/
babel   mocha    phantomjs
coffee  nodemon  semver
```

```bash
$ ??? ???
```

* `npm`
* `bin`
* `ls`
* `/project/node_modules/.bin`
* `/usr/local/bin`
