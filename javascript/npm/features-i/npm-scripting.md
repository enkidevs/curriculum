# Npm Scripting

---
## Content

`npm` is a lot more than just a package manager for Node. It supports scripting using the `run-script` (or the abbreviated `run`) option.

Scripts can be specified inside *package.json*:

```javascript
{
  "name": "enki",
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "myScript": "echo firstScript"
  }
}
```

And invoked using:

```bash
$ npm run myScript
firstScript
```

Why is this great? Say you are using CSS preprocessors like *LESS* or *SASS* and you have to compile them into *CSS* files. All you have to do is specify `less` as a *devDependency* and include this script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-less": `lessc app/less/main.less
      prod/css/main.css`
}
```

Running:

```bash
$ npm run build-less
```

Will produce the *.css* file.

Another cool thing about scripting is that you can combine multiple sub-scripts into a single one like so:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-less":`lessc app/less/main.less
      prod/css/main.css`,
  "build-js":`coffee --output prod/js/
      --compile app/js/main.js`,
  "build":`npm run build-less &
      npm run build-js`
}
```

This will speed up the process as two subshells will be invoked to resolve each build command (asynchronously) because of the `&` token.

## Practice

Fill in the following `package.json` file such that it has 2 scripts:
One called `test` which will run `jest` and another called `test:ci` which will run the first script with `-- --runInBand` option:

```json
{
  "name": "Enki",
  "???": {
    "???": "???",
    "???": "??? ???"
  }
}
```

* scripts
* test
* jest
* test:ci
* npm run test
* -- runInBand
* script
* node-scripts
* testing
* test --
* runInBand
* run test
* npm

## Revision


Given the following is in your `package.json`, execute the script called `dailyStats`
```javascript
{
  "name": "enki",
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dailyStats": "node ./bin/stats.js"
  }
}
```

??? ??? ???

* npm
* run
* dailyStats
* script
* exec
