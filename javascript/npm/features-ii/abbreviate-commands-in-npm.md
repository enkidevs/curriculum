`npm` uses `abbrev` program to provide abbreviations for its commands. Shorthands for most common commands are also available.


Useful abbreviations:
```bash
npm i myPackage
# same as npm install myPackage
npm r myPackage / npm rm myPackage
# same as npm uninstall myPackage
npm ln
# same as npm link
npm ls
# same as npm list
npm bn
# same as npm bundle
npm up
# same as npm update
npm c
# same as npm config

```

In addition, `npm` uses **tab completion** which can be modified in the `npm-completion.sh` script file located in the `npm` source folder.
