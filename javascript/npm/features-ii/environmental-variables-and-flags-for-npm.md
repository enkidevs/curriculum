# Flags for 

`npm`


---

## Content

Configuration options such as **environment variables** and **command line flags** that are used for *Node.js* are also available for the `npm` package manager.

In particular the `npm run` and `npm start` commands let you set required **flags** (like the old `--harmony`) before running.

For instance:

```javascript
env NODE_PATH=./ node myProject/index.js
```

The script will add the specified directory to the `require()` function's module search path. If this script is used in the testing modules (supposedly in another directory), `require()` will know to look in the current directory resulting in better path organization.

Suppose your application relies on the `env NODE_PATH ./` trick, but also on other flags, a starting script can be easily defined:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "env NODE_PATH=./ node
        --harmony_proxies index.js"
  }
}
```

## Practice

How would you add an environmental variable called `API_KEY` that's equal to `xyz` at the runtime of you node application? Suppose the main file of you application is `index.js`

```bash
$ ????????? ??? ???
```

* API_KEY
* =
* xyz
* node
* index.js
* &&
* API
* ENVS
* =\[
* API_KEY("xyz")]

## Revision

In `package.json`, define a script that runs `node index.js`. Add to it the `--harmony` flag at the end and an env variable called `API_KEY` that's equal to "abc".

```json
{
  "name": "Enki",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "???=??? ??? ??? ???"
  }
}
```

* API_KEY
* abc
* node
* index.js
* \--harmony
* add
* run
* scripts
* npm
* \--har
* \-h
* "abc"
