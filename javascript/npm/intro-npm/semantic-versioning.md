## Content

It's almost always better to use the newest version of a package as it often offers fixes or improvements to its functionality. As a package maintainer it is important to communicate any changes made in a release as it may break code[1] depending on the package.

For package maintainers, there are some guidelines when it comes to versioning:
 - the first version should be *1.0.0*, though it's not a necessity
 - patch releases and bug fixes should increment the last number, *1.0.0* to *1.0.1*
 - minor releases and new features that don't break existing functionality should increment the middle number, *1.0.0* to *1.1.0*
 - major releases or changes which break backwards compatibility should increment the first number, *1.0.0* to *2.0.0*

You can specify which updates to the packages you would want to receive:
  - the latest patch: *1.0* or *1.0.x* or *~1.0.0*
  - the latest minor release: *1* or *1.x* or *^1.0.0*
  - the latest major release: *\* or *x*
