## Content

There are two types of packages you can include in your project:
 - **dependencies**: used in production
 - **devDependencies**: used in development and testing

In a project that uses the latest minor *express 4* release in production and *jest 18.0.0* in development, *package.json* should have these attributes:
```
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.0.0",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "18.0.0",
  }
}
```
Another way to specify each dependency is using the command line:
```bash
#dependencies
$ npm install express@^4.0.0 --save
#devDependencies
$ npm install jest --save-dev
```
Both will install the specified versions of *express* and *jest* and also add them to the *package.json* file.

You can list all the existing dependencies of your project with:
```
$ npm list
~/project
|__ express@4.14.0
|__ jest@18.0.0
```
This is the true power of *npm*. What would have required a lot of individual downloading and importing, is now solvable by adding a new line in the *package.json* file.

## Practice

Packages that the application is dependent on are specified in

???

* package.json file
* node_modules directory
* dependencies.json file
* devDependencies.json file

---
## Revision

Install and add *gulp* to the list of dev dependencies from the command line:
```
$ ??? ??? ??? ???
```
* `npm`
* `install`
* `gulp`
* `--save-dev`
* `--save`
* `node`
