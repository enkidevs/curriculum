## Content

So far, we've used the terms *package* and *module* somehow interchangeably. However, there is a sensible difference between the two and it has to do with the way in which node works.

In short, a **package** is a file or directory that contains a *package.json*. It is something that, by reading its *package.json* file, can be characterized by a *name*, a *version*, a *tag*, or a *git repository url*.

Even if a package is not published to the public registry (you will be shown how to do that in a future workout), it can provide the same benefits, such as avoiding code repetition.

A **module**, on the other hand, is anything that you can load in a project using `require()`. To some extent, packages can be modules, but this is not required.

There are some packages, such as command line interface ones, that contain an executable but don't provide the *main* field which makes them importable by *Node.js*.

### *package.json* and *node_modules*
The above definitions explain the nomenclature chosen for the two npm resources: *package.json* and *node_modules*.

The *package.json* file defines the package, while the *node_modules* is the place where *Node.js* will look for imports specified with `require()`.

You could have a module *node_modules/myModule.js*, for which:
```
var a = require('myModule.js');
```
Would be valid. However, *myModule* isn't a *package*, as it is missing the attributes of a package specified inside the *package.json* file.

Alternatively, if a *package* doesn't have an *index.js* or a *main* field in the *package.json*, then it isn't a module. Even if you could find it inside the *node_modules* directory, node won't be able to import it.

## Practice

For a module to be a package as well, it has to

???

* have a package.json file
* be published
* have an index.js file
* be required
---
## Revision

Node's `require()` looks for code in

???

* `node_modules`
* `package.json`
* `node_packages`
