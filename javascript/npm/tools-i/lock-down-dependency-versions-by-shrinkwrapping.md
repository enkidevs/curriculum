## Content

`npm` has great support for semanting versioning because it uses wildcards and expressions for versions of dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:
```json
{  //other props
   "dependencies": {
      "module-a": "2.3.x",
      "module-b": "<=1.5.0"
  }
}
```
However, **unexpected failure** can occur when running `npm install` over time due to updated versions of your dependencies.

The command:
```bash
$ npm shrinkwrap
```
generates a snapshot of the current dependency tree and will lock down versions of dependencies.

This is done by automatically generating the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file which will override dependency versioning of `package.json`.

## Practice

What command do you need to run as to generate a snapshot of the current dependency tree and lock down versions inside it?

```
$ ??? ???
```

* `npm`
* `shrinkwrap`
* `lock`
* `dependencies`
* `package.json`
* `npm-shrinkwrap`
