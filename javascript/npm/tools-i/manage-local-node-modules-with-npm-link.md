# Manage local node modules with 

`npm link`


---

## Content

A modular Node.js application often implies the usage of certain local modules.

To support subsequent modification of those modules and to not need to go through re-installations or code changes one can use the `npm` commmand `npm link`. This will create a *symbolic link* between packages.

The whole linking process consists of two steps, the first being declaring a module as a global link. This is done by running :

```bash
$ npm link
// must be run in the root module folder
```

Secondly, to install the linked modules in the target app using the following command:

```bash
$ npm link myImportedModule
```

This method fails when you have a local module depending on another local module:

```text
modules/moduleOne
modules/moduleTwo -> depends on moduleOne
app/
```

To solve this steps must be taken:

```bash
$ cd modules/moduleOne
$ npm link
$ cd modules/moduleTwo
$ npm link moduleOne
$ npm link
$ cd app/
$ npm link moduleTwo
```

## Practice

Which of the following statements is false about `npm link`?

???

* uses the online npm registry to link global packages
* creates a symbolic link between packages
* allows easier local development when working with multiple libraries
* allows you to use a local library without reinstalling it after each time


---

## Revision

Consider your main application relies on an external library `myLibrary` you have access to. The latter one requires some modifications too, but it would be to menial to reinstall it with each change.

Which npm command can you use to make you application use your local version of the library?

```bash
$ npm ???
```

* link myLibrary
* link
* \--use-local:myLibrary
* \--local:myLibrary
* \--use-local=myLibrary
* \--local=myLibrary
