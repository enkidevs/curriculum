# Component **lifecycle methods**

---
## Content

As discussed before, **lifecycle methods** can be used to target a specific point in the *life* of a `component`.

We can split them into three broader categories by the *type of event* that will trigger them:

### 1. Mounting

- `constructor(props)` - the first method called in the lifecycle, **before mounting**. It's most commonly used to set the initial `state` and to `bind` methods. If used, it must include `super(props)` as first call:

```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    time: new Date();
  }
}

```

- `componentWillMount()` - is invoked **just before** `render`. Modifying the `state` here won't trigger a **re-render**.

- `componentDidMount()` - is invoked **after** `render`. Useful for initialisations that require `DOM` nodes.


### 2. Updating

- `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)` - is only called after `render`ing, but **before** receiving new `props`. Because **React** may call this method although `props` stay the same its recommended to manually implement a check to see if there's a difference.

- `shouldComponentUpdate(nxtProps, nxtState)` - the method is called **before** receiving new `props` or `state`. By default it returns `true` meaning `render` is triggered by any change. Modifying this method allows you to only re-`render` in intended scenarios.

- `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)` - is invoked if `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `true`, **before** `render`. Note you can't use `this.setState()` here.

- `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)` - is invoked **after** `render`, but not after the initial one. This method is useful for manipulating the `DOM` when updated

### 3. Unmounting

- `componentWillUnmount()` - is invoked immediately **before** a `component` is unmounted and destroyed. Useful for resource cleanup.
