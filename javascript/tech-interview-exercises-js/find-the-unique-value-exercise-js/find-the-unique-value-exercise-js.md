# Find the Unique Value

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that finds the unique value from a list of numbers. The function should have linear complexity.**

For instance, if the input list is: 

```javascript
let numbers = [13, 13, 44, 44, 1, 1, 7, 7, 9]
```

the function should return `9` since it is the only element in the list that does not have a duplicate:

```javascript
find_unique(numbers)
// 9
```
