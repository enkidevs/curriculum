# Understanding Exceptions ðŸš¨

---
## Content

Computer programs are rigid - they expect data and operations to follow exact rules. 

When these rules are broken, the program encounters an **exception** - an error that disrupts normal operation.

> ðŸ’¥ When an exception happens, we say it caused the program to crash.

Common scenarios that cause exceptions:
1. Dividing by zero
2. Converting invalid text to a number
3. Reading a file that doesn't exist

For example:
```kotlin
// This will crash with NumberFormatException
val number = "abc".toInt()

// This will crash with ArithmeticException
val result = 10 / 0
```

Kotlin provides tools to:
1. Detect exceptions (using `try`)
2. Handle exceptions (using `catch`)
3. Clean up resources (using `finally`)

> ðŸŽ¯ Handling exceptions is like giving your program a second chance to deal with the error gracefully.

## Practice

What happens when a program encounters an unhandled exception?

???

- The program crashes
- The program continues running
- The program fixes the error
- The program restarts

---

## Revision

Match the situation with the likely exception:

```kotlin
"abc".toInt() â†’ ???
5 / 0 â†’ ???
```

- NumberFormatException
- ArithmeticException
