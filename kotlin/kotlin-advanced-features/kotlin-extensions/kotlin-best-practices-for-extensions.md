# Best Practices for Extensions üõ†Ô∏è

---
## Content

When creating and using Kotlin extensions, follow these best practices:

1. **Keep Extensions Simple**: Avoid complex logic to maintain readability.
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Clearly indicate the purpose of your extensions.
3. **Document Extensions**: Use comments to explain what your extensions do.

Refactored Example:

```kotlin
/**
 * Checks if the string is a palindrome.
 */
fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean = this == this.reversed()

val result = "level".isPalindrome()
```

- **Simplified Logic**: Uses a single-expression function for clarity.
- **Documentation**: Adds a comment to explain the function's purpose.
