# Threading Basics

---
## Content

Threads are one of the most traditional approaches to prevent applications from blocking:

```kotlin
fun postItem(item: Item) {
    // This would block the main thread
    val token = preparePost()
    val post = submitPost(token, item)
    processPost(post)
}

// Using threads to avoid blocking
thread {
    val token = preparePost()
    val post = submitPost(token, item)
    processPost(post)
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ While threads are powerful, they're not always the best solution due to:
> - High resource costs
> - Platform limitations
> - Complexity in debugging
> - Race condition risks
