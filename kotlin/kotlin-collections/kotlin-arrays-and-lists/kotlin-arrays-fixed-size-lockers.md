# Arrays: Fixed Size Lockers

---
## Content

Arrays in Kotlin are like a row of lockers, each holding one item. 

Once set, their size can't change, similar to a fixed number of lockers in a gym.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    println(numbers[0]) // Access the first element
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Arrays are fixed in size and created with the `arrayOf()` function.

Each item has a position number starting from 0. Use `numbers[0]` to get the first item, `numbers[1]` for the second item, and so on.

> ðŸ’¡ An array position is called an *index*.
