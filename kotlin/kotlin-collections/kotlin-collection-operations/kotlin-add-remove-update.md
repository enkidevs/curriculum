# Collection Operations: Add, Remove, Update

---
## Content

You can perform various operations on collections in Kotlin, like adding, removing, and updating elements. It's like managing items in your storage boxes.

- **Add**: Use `add()` for sets and `put()` for maps.
- **Remove**: Use `remove()` for both sets and maps.
- **Update**: Directly assign new values in maps using `put()` or the bracket notation.

> ðŸ’¡ These operations help you manage your collections dynamically.

Next, we'll explore how to filter and transform collections.
