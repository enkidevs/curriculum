# Iterating: Looping Through Collections

---
## Content

Iterating over collections in Kotlin is like going through each item in your storage boxes, one by one.

**For Loop**: Access each element in a collection.

```kotlin
for (score in scores) {
    println(score * 3)
}
  ```

> ðŸ’¡ Iteration lets you process each element in a collection.
