# If Statements 🌞

---
## Content

if statements let your program make decisions based on conditions. It’s like deciding to wear sunglasses if it’s sunny.

The

```kotlin
if (temp > 30) {
    println("🕶️")
}
```

How It Works:
- The `if` statement checks if the condition `temp > 30` is true.
- If true, it executes the code inside the `{ }` block and prints `"🕶️"`.
- If false, it skips the block entirely.

---
## Practice

What will this Kotlin code print if `temp` is 35?

```kotlin
fun checkTemperature(temp: Int) {
    if (temp > 30) {
        println("It's hot!")
    }
}
```

It will print ???.

- It's hot!
- Nothing
- It's cold!


---
## Revision

An ??? statement is used to ??? a condition.

- `if`
- `check`
- `store`
- `maybe`
