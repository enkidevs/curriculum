# Comparison Operators 

---
## Content

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a true or false result. 

> ğŸ’¡ An *operator* is just a fancy word for a symbol that performs an operation.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `==` | Equal to | `5 == 5` returns `true` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `5 != 3` returns `true` | 
| `>` | Greater than | `5 > 3` returns `true` |
| `<` | Less than | `5 < 3` returns `false` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5` returns `true` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `5 <= 5` returns `true` |

> ğŸ’¡ Comparison operators works just like in math.

## Practice

Fill in the gaps to make the comparison operators work:

```kotlin
val a = 5
val b = 3

println(a ??? b) // true
```

- `>`
- `==`
- `<`
- `<=`

---
## Revision

What will this Kotlin code print?

```kotlin
val a = 5
val b = 3

println(a != b) // ???
```

- `true`
- `false`
