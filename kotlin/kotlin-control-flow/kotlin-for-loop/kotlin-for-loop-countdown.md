# For Loop Countdown

---
## Content

You can count down by using the `downTo` keyword:

```kotlin
for (i in 10 downTo 1) {
    println(i)
}
```

What Happens:
- The loop starts with `i = 10` and goes down to `1`.
- Each time through the loop, the value of `i` decreases by `1`.
- The program prints the value of `i` during each loop.

---
## Practice

Finish the code to print the numbers 99 to 0.

```kotlin
for (i in ??? ??? ???) {
    println(i)
}
```

- `99`
- `downTo`
- `0`
- `0..99`
- `down`
