# For Loop

---
## Content

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Without loops, here's how you would print the numbers 1 to 10:

```kotlin
println(1)
println(2)
println(3)
println(4)
println(5)
println(6)
println(7)
println(8)
println(9)
println(10)
```

But with a for loop, you can do this:

```kotlin
for (i in 1..10) {
    println(i)
}
```

What Happens:
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `10`.
- Each time through the loop, the value of `i` increases by `1`.
- The program prints the value of `i` during each loop.

One run of a loop is called an **iteration**.

> ðŸ”„ A for loop is like counting items on a shelf, one item at a time.

## Practice

Finish the code to print the numbers 1 to 10.

```kotlin
??? (i in ???) {
    println(i)
}
```

- `for`
- `1..10`
- `four`
- `1.10`

## Revision

One run of a loop is called an ???

- `iteration`
- `loop`
- `function`
