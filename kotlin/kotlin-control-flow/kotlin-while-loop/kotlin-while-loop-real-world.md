# While Loop Real World

---
## Content

You can imagine a loop being used for animation, kind of like those flip book cartoons that animate when you turn the pages really fast.

Here's how you might write a game loop that keeps repainting the screen until the game is over:   

```kotlin
while (isGameRunning) {
  repaintScreen()
  if (gameOver() || playerQuit()) {
    isGameRunning = false
  }
}
```

## Practice

What will this Kotlin while loop print?

```kotlin
var isGameRunning = true
while (isGameRunning) {
  println("still running")
  isGameRunning = false
}
```

It will print ???.

- `still running` once
- `still running` twice
- `still running` three times
- `still running` forever

## Revision

What will this code print?

```kotlin
var isGameRunning = false
while (isGameRunning) {
  println("still running")
  isGameRunning = false
}
```

- `nothing`
- `still running` once
- `still running` twice
- `still running` forever
