# Addition and Subtraction

---
## Content

In Kotlin, addition and subtraction are like putting apples in or taking them out of a basket.

They help you calculate totals or differences.

```kotlin
val sum = 8 + 12
println(sum) // 20

val difference = 20 - 5
println(difference) // 15
```

> âž• **Addition**: Combine numbers with `+` to get a total.
>
> âž– **Subtraction**: Find the difference between numbers with `-`

> ðŸ’¡These operations are essential for tasks like calculating the sum of prices in a shopping cart or determining how much money you have left after a purchase.
