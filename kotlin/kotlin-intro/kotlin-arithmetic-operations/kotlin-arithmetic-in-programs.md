# Using Arithmetic in Programs

---
## Content

Arithmetic operations are crucial for real-world tasks like calculating a delivery order total.

```kotlin
val bill = 100
val tipPercent = 15

val totalWithTip = totalBill + (totalBill * tipPercent / 100) // Add tip
println(totalWithTip) // 115
```

> 🚀 Your turn! Can you think of another arithmetic use case to solve an everyday problem? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
