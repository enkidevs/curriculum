# Multiplication and Division

---
## Content

Multiplication and division in Kotlin are like multiplying apples in baskets or sharing them among friends.

```kotlin
val product = 4 * 5
println(product) // Outputs: 20

val quotient = 20 / 4
println(quotient) // Outputs: 5
```

> ✖️ **Multiplication**: Scale numbers by a factor using `*`

> ➗ **Division**: Split numbers into equal parts using `/`

These operations help in scaling quantities, like calculating total cost for multiple items or dividing a bill among friends.
