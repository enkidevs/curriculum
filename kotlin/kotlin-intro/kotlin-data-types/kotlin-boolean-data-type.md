# Boolean Data Type

---
## Content

The Boolean data type is like a yes-or-no question‚Äîit‚Äôs either true or false, like deciding whether you need an umbrella.

```kotlin
val isRaining: Boolean = true
val needUmbrella: Boolean = isRaining
println(needUmbrella) // Prints: true
```

Here, isRaining is true, so you need an umbrella.

> ‚úÖ Boolean: A data type for true/false situations.

Think about daily true/false questions:

```kotlin
val isLunchTime: Boolean = true
println(isLunchTime) // Prints: true
```

```kotlin
val hasHomework: Boolean = false
println(hasHomework) // Prints: false
```

> Now think of your own Boolean scenarios‚Äîwhat yes/no questions do you face? üßê
