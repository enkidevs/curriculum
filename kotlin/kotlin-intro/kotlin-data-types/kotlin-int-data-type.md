## Content

In Kotlin, the **Int** data type is used for whole numbers, like counting books or steps.

It's perfect for any situation where you need to work with numbers without fractions.

```kotlin
val age: Int = 25
val numberOfBooks: Int = 55
val totalGameLevels = 10
```

You can perform arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction with Ints.
