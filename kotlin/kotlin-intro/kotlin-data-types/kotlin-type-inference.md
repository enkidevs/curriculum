# Kotlin's Magic: Type Inference

---
## Content

Kotlin can automatically figure out the type of a variable based on its value, a feature called type inference.

It’s like understanding someone’s mood based on their facial expression—Kotlin “reads” the value and decides the type.

For example:

```kotlin
val number = 10
```

Here, Kotlin recognizes the value is an `Int` without you explicitly stating it. This keeps your code neat and easy to read.

> 💡 The concept of Kotlin determining a type of a value is called **type inference**


---
## Practice

Which of these uses type inference correctly?

A) `val number: Int = 10` B) `val number = 10` C) `var number: Int` D)
`var number = "10"`

???

- B
- A
- C
- D

## Revision

Type ??? allows Kotlin to ??? the type of a variable.

- `guess`
- `inference`
- `interpretation`
- `interference`
- `ignore`
- `change`
