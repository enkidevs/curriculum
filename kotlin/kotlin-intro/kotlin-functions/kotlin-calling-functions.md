# Calling Functions

---
## Content

To make the computer perform the tasks inside a function, you must call the function. 

Calling a function is like saying, ‚ÄúGo do the tasks written in this recipe!‚Äù

> üí° Function calling means making the computer do what the code inside the function says.

```kotlin
fun greet() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}

// Call the function
greet() // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

Here, the `greet()` function is called, and the computer performs the task inside it, which is printing ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.

> üí° Function calling is also known as *executing* or *running* the function.

Without calling the function, nothing happens.

> üí° Defining a function is like writing a recipe, but calling it is like actually cooking the dish. üç≥
