# Defining Functions

---
## Content

In Kotlin, you define a function using the `fun` keyword. It's like telling Kotlin, "I'm about to describe a task!"

```kotlin
fun greet() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

- **`fun`**: This keyword tells Kotlin you're defining a function.
- **`greet`**: The name of the function. Choose a name that describes what the function does, like naming a recipe "Pancakes".

> ðŸ”§ **Function**: A block of code that performs a specific task.
