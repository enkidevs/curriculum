# Comments

---
## Content

The `//` symbol in Kotlin is for commentsâ€”notes that Kotlin ignores.

```kotlin
// this is a note
println("Hello, Kotlin!")
```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use comments to explain what your code does.

```kotlin
// Create a score variable and set it to 0
var score = 0
```

You can put comments on the same line too:

```kotlin
var score = 0 // here
```

Weâ€™ll use comments to explain Kotlin code in this course! ðŸ˜Š
