# Hello, World! Program in Kotlin

---
## Content

Let's write your first Kotlin program:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}
```

> ðŸš€ **A program** is like a recipe that tells a computer what to do step by step.

This program displays "Hello, Kotlin!" on the screen.

Don't worry about understanding everything, we'll explain it all soon ðŸ˜Š


---
## Practice

Finish the code below to display the welcome message on the screen:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    ???("Welcome to Kotlin!")
}
```

- `println`
- `display`
- `show`
- `visualize`


---
## Revision

In the code block below, match the meaning with the keyword:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

main: ??? println: ???

- the starting point of every Kotlin program
- a command to tell the computer to display a message
