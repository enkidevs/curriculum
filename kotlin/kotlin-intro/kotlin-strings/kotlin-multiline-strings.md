# Multiline Strings

---
## Content

Use triple quotes `"""` for multiline strings. They preserve formatting and are great for long text, like writing a letter or a poem.

```kotlin
val letter = """
Dear User,

Thank you for choosing our service. We hope you have a great experience.

Best regards,
The Team
"""
println(letter)
```

**Why it matters:** Multiline strings simplify handling large text blocks without losing formatting, much like keeping the paragraphs in a letter neatly aligned.
