# Real-World String Templates

---
## Content

Imagine youâ€™re creating a weather app that displays the temperature and weather
condition:

```kotlin
val city = "London"
val temperature = 15
val condition = "sunny"
val weatherMessage = "Today in $city, it's $temperatureÂ°C and $condition."
println(weatherMessage)
```

The `weatherMessage` will display on the screen as:

    Today in London, it's 15Â°C and sunny.

> ðŸš€ With string templates, you can dynamically update messages in apps, making
> them personalized and efficient!
