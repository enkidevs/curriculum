# String Concatenation

---
## Content

You can combine Strings using the `+` operator to create new messages or names:

```kotlin
val firstName: String = "Enki"
val lastName: String = "Teacher"
val fullName: String = firstName + " is my " + lastName
println(fullName) // Prints: Enki is my Teacher
```

Joining two or more strings is called **concatenation**.

> ðŸ’¡ Concatenation is useful for creating dynamic messages, much like forming a complete sentence from individual words.

Let's see a real world example.
