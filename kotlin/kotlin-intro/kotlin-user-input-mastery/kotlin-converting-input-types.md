# Kotlin Input Conversion

---
## Content

When receiving user input in Kotlin, it is initially read as a String (text). To perform calculations or logic, you need to convert it to the appropriate type, like Int for numbers.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Enter your current age:")
    val ageInput = readLine() ?: "0" // Read input and ensure itâ€™s not null
    val age = ageInput.toInt() // Convert input to Int
    val yearsLeft = 65 - age // Calculate years until retirement
    println("You have $yearsLeft years until retirement.")
}
```

Without converting input to the correct type, you canâ€™t perform meaningful operations like math or comparisons. For example, "25" is text and canâ€™t be used in arithmetic, but 25 as an Int can.

> ðŸ’¡ Use `toInt()`, `toDouble()`, `toBoolean()`, etc. to convert input to the correct type.
