# Reading Input with readLine()

---
## Content

Kotlinâ€™s `readLine()` function lets you capture user input from the console. Think of it as a microphone that listens to what you type.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Enter your name:")
    val name = readLine() ?: "" // Reads input and ensures a default empty string if input is null
    println("Hello, $name!")
}
```

> ðŸ“¥ **User Input**: Data you provide to your program, typically through a keyboard.

Reading input allows your program to interact with users, making it dynamic and responsive, just like a friendly chat.
