# Try it Yourself!

## Content

Think of something youâ€™d like to track, and create variables with the right type.

Here are some examples:

```kotlin
var favoriteBook = "The Hobbit" // Use String for text
var studyHours = 3 // Use Int for numbers
var isLearningFun = true // Use Boolean for true/false
```

Now itâ€™s your turn! Create your own variables based on what youâ€™d like to track.
