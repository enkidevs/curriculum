# Why Types Matter

---
## Content

Each variable type in Kotlin has specific operations you can perform.

For example, you can add two `Int` values, but you can't add a `String` to an `Int` directly.

> 💡 It's like using the right tool for a job; a hammer is great for nails, but not for screws.

Understanding these types helps you write more efficient and error-free code.

## Practice

Why can't you add a `String` to an `Int` directly in Kotlin?

???

- They are different types
- Strings are numbers
- Ints are text

## Revision

Using the right variable type is like using the right ??? for a job.

- `tool`
- `color`
- `size`
