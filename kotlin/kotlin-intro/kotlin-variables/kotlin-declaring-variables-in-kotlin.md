# Declaring Variables

---
## Content

In Kotlin, you declare a variable using the `var` or `val` keyword:

- **`var`**: Use this when you want a variable that can change. Think of it as a box you can open and replace the contents.
- **`val`**: Use this for a variable that won't change. It's like a sealed box that you can't open once it's closed.

```kotlin
var age = 25
val name = "Enki"
```

- **`age`** is a variable that can change. You might update it next year.
- **`name`** is a constant. Once set, it stays the same.
