# Real-World Variable Example

---
## Content

Imagine you're building a simple app that tracks your daily steps. You could use a variable to store the number of steps you take each day:

```kotlin
var stepsToday = 0
stepsToday = 5000
```

Initially, `stepsToday` is 0. As you walk, you update it to reflect your progress.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tracking**: Use variables to keep track of changing data, like daily steps.

## Practice

On Saturday, you walked 4,000 steps.

On Sunday, you added another 3,500 steps to your total.

Update the variable to reflect this.

```kotlin
var stepsThisWeekend = 4000 // Steps from Saturday
???
println(stepsThisWeekend) // Print the total steps
```

- `stepsThisWeekend = stepsThisWeekend + 3500`
- `stepsThisWeekend + 3500`
- `stepsThisWeekend add 3500`
- `stepsThisWeekend increase by 3500`
