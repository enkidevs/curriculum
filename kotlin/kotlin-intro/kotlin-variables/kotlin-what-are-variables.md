# Understanding Variables

---
## Content

Variables in programming are like labeled boxes where you can store data.

Imagine having a box labeled 'age' where you keep your age.

You can change what's inside the box anytime, just like updating your age every year.

> 📦 **Variables** allow you to store and change data in your programs. For example, if you have a variable named 'score' in a game, you can update it as the player earns points.
