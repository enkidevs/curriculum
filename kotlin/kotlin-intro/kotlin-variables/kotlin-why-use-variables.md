# Why Use Variables?

---
## Content

Variables store and manage data dynamically in programs, like tracking a userâ€™s score in a game.

> ðŸ’¡ Flexibility: Variables make data easy to update and manage.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var score = 0 // Declares a variable 'score' and sets it to 0
    println(score) // 0

    score = score + 10 // increase score by 10
    println(score) // 10
}
```

You can easily update the value in one place, and it reflects everywhere.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var score = 5 // setting initial score to 5 doesn't require changing the increase logic below

    score = score + 10 // increase score by 10
    println(score) // 15
}
```

Variables make programs ??? by allowing data to change, which is useful for ???
data.

- `flexible`
- `dynamic`
- `static`
- `rigid`

## Revision

Using variables allows you to ??? values in your programs, making them ???.

- `change`
- `dynamic`
- `lock`
- `hide`
