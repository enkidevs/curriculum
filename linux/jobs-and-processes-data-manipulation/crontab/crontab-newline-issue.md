# `Crontab` newline issue

---
## Content

If you forget to add a newline at the end of the `crontab` file, it won't run the last job in the list. 

The `crontab` file should always end with an empty line.


Running the `crontab -e` command on the machine we can modify the content of the `crontab` file.

An example of such file is:

```
*/30 * * * * say -v whisper "I can see you"

# don't forget the newline!
```

Note how after the last command there is an empty line ensuring that the `whisper` command will run.
