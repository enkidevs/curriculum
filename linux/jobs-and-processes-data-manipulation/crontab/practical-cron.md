# Practical `cron`

---
## Content

Linux Cron utility is an effective way to schedule a routine background job at a specific time and/or day on an on-going basis.

The linux crontab format is as follows:
```
MINUTE HOUR DATE MONTH WEEKDAY COMMAND
```

To list the current cron jobs, use `-l` : 
```
$ crontab -l
```
To check another user's crontab, use `-u user` with the `-l` flag:
```
$ crontab -u username -l
```

To edit the crontab, use `-e`:
```
$ crontab -e
```
Some common used *special characters* are:
- `*` = every possible value[1]
- `-` = range[2]
- `/x` = values that are repetead over and over again[3]
- `%` = output to `stdout`[4]
- `?` = executes the command at Cron start time[5]
-  `Mon - Sun` instead of `1-7`[6]

For example, to set a cron job that executes at 9:00, 9:15, 18:00, 18:15, of every Monday and Friday in January and August:
```
00,15 09,18 Jan,Aug * 1,5
            /root/check_cache.sh
```

To execute something every 10 minutes before half-past of every hour:
```
0-30/10 * * * * macchanger -A eth0
#00, 10, 20, 30
```

??? ??? * * 
        ??? myScript.py
```

* `20,22`
* `6`
* `00,00`
* `Saturday`
* `*`

## Footnotes
[1:Example]
`*` in the Minute field means the command is executed every minute
[2:Example]
`1-5` in the Weekday field means the command is executed every day, Monday to Friday
[3:Example]
`/9` in the Minute field means the command is executed every 9 minutes
[4:Example]
`* * * * * - % a minute has passed` will output *a minute has passed* to the console. Each `%` represents a new line.
[5:Example]
`/5 ? * * *` means it will execute every 5 minutes in the hour the Cron has started, every day of every month (i.e. if Cron starts at 10, the command will be changed automatically to `/5 10 * * *`).
[6:Sunday]
`Sun` can be both `0` and `7`. *0-6* means Sunday to Saturday, while *1-7* means Monday to Sunday.The same is true for months. The notation depends on the distribution.
