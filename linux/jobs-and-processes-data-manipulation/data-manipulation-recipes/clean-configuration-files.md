# Clean configuration files

## Content

Over commented *configuration* files can be difficult to read and manage. 

Backup the original and clean the comments with a function added to the login script:

```shell
function clean_file {
sed -i.bak "/^\s*[#;]/d;/^$/d" $1
} 
```
The option `-i` is used to run an in-place edit. The suffix `bak` tells `sed` to create a backup of the file before the edit.

Some versions of `sed` might require `-i.tmp` to do the same thing.

The function is used to search for commented lines and empty lines and remove them. 

A shell script accepts comments starting with `#` or `;` . Therefore, this script can be modified to work for all kind of languages by changing the comment delimiters.

**Usage:**

```shell
$ sudo clean_file /etc/ntp/conf
```

## Revision

A script to delete comments and empty lines from configuration files would use the 

??? command .


* sed
* clr
* del
* cd
