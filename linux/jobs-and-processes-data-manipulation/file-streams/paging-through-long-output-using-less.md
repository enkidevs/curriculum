# Paging Through Long Output Using `less`

---
## Content

The `less` command is a "pager", which allows you to scroll and search through streams of output that are too long for a single page.

A simple example:

```shell
ps aux | less
```

`ps aux` will print detailed information about the currently running processes and likely take up several screens worth of text.  By piping its output to `less` we can scroll through the output more easily.

Use the arrows keys to move up, down, left, and right through the output.  Pressing the spacebar will scroll you forward a single page while pressing the `b` key will scroll you backwards a single page.

To exit `less` press the `q` key.

### Searching With `less`

`less` is also capable of searching through the output. To search, press the `/` key to enter "search mode", type the keyword or pattern you want to search for, and hit the enter key. `less` will take you to the first **forward** match. If you want to go backwards, type `?` followed by the pattern, and `less` will find the **backward** match.

To navigate the matches:
- for the next forward match
  - press `n`
  - type `/` and press enter
- for the next backward match
  - press `N`
  - type `?` and press enter

### What's With The Name?

In the same way that `bash` (the Bourne Again Shell) is a play on its predecessor `sh` (the Bourne Shell), `less` is a play on its predecessor `more`.  The `more` command exists on most systems but is much more limited than `less`.  For example, it's impossible to scroll backwards with `more`.

### Read The Manpage!

Run `man less` to read `less`'s manual (aka "manpage"), or take a look at the resources.
