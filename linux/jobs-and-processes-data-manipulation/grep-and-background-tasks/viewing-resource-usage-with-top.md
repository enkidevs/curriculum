# Viewing Resource Usage With `top`

---
## Content

Whereas `ps` will display a snapshot of the currently-running processes, the `top` command will give a continuous, sortable display.  `top` is often used to see which processes are consuming the most CPU or memory.

Here is some example output from `top`, sorted by memory usage.  The `...` represent columns deleted in order to make the output fit:

```text
PID   USER   ...  %CPU %MEM    TIME+ COMMAND
14944 jesse  ...  0.0  9.5  17:03.55 ruby
14947 jesse  ...  0.0  9.2  17:03.19 ruby
3164  mysql  ...  0.3  2.5  13:31.83 mysqld
```

You can read `man top` to learn about all the ways to configure the display.  On Linux, the following commands are common:

1. Type `P` to sort by CPU usage (an actual capital `P`, not `p`)
2. Type `M` to sort by memory usage
3. Type `<` to move the sorted column one to the left
4. Type `>` to move the sorted column one to the right
5. Type `q` to quit

## Practice

In contrast to `ps` , `top` displays processes 

??? .

* in real time
* as a snapshot
* sorted by memory usage
* of all users
* only owned by the current user

---
## Revision

To display the processes running in real time, you would use 

???.

* top
* ps
* ms
* procstat
