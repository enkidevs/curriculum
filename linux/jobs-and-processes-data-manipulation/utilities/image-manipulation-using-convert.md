# Image manipulation  using `convert`

---
## Content

`convert`[1] can be used to change image formats as well as resize, crop, rotate and many other options. Its basic structure is:
```
$ convert [in-opts] in-file [out-opts]
      out-file
```

For example:
```
$ convert Dog.png -resize x250 -rotate 90
  -quality 90% -charcoal 5 newDog.jpg
```

The above will resize the *height*[2] to 250, *rotate* the picture 90 degrees to the right, reduce its *quality* to 90% , apply an *effect*[3] of strength 5 and finally changing its format to a `.jpg`.

## Revision

Use the `convert` command to resize the height of `enki.png` to `200` and rename it `newEnki.jpg`:

```
$ ??? enki.png ???
  ??? newEnki.jpg
```


* `convert`
* `-resize`
* `x200`
* `--resize`
* `200px`
* `200`
* `-toJPG`

## Footnotes
[1:Where to get it]
Part of ` imagemagick` suit of tools.
[2:Size]
Resizing both width and height requires 250x250, while resizing the width requires only 250.
[3:Range]
The strength range depends on the effect type.
