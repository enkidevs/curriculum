# Get rid of duplicate lines


---

## Content

Here is a one liner tip for you:

```bash
awk '!(count[$0]++)' file_to_filter

```

This is using `awk` to print the first occurrence of every line, no matter how many times the same line would appear afterwards - `{print}` is the default instruction.

When a line is read (`$0` references the current line), it adds to an array that keeps track of the number of occurrences.

The first time a line is met, awk prints it because `!0` is the equivalent of `true`. If the line was met before, `!count[line]` will only output `false`, therefore it won't be printed again.

Or if you don't mind sorting your lines:

```bash
sort file_to_filter | uniq
```

If *file_to_filter* contains:

```plain-text
cookie
cookie
doughnut
cake
croissant
cake
```

The output will be:

```plain-text
#awk
cookie
doughnut
cake
croissant

#sort
cake
cookie
croissant
doughnut
```

## Revision

Sorting the lines of a file in order to get rid of the duplicates can be done using :

```bash
??? file_to_filter | ???
```

- `sort`
- `uniq`
- `unique`
- `sed`
