# Bandwidth monitoring tools


---

## Content

Here are some tools provided by the Ubuntu repos for network monitoring:

`iftop` - display network interface bandwidth usage

`bmon` - portable bandwidth monitor and rate estimator that can measure multiple interfaces at once.

`slurm` - network load monitor that  can display colored graphs.

`tcptrack` - reveals how much bandwidth a protocol is using, destination and source addresses, and ports.

`vnstat` - it keeps track of the network traffic for the selected interfaces and it works without root permissions.

Each can be used for specific monitoring or basic statistics.
