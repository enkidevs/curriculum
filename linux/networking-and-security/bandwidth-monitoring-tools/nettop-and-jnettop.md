# `nettop` and `jnettop`

---
## Content

`nettop` (MacOS) and its Debian/OpedBSD equivalent `jnettop` are command line tools for monitoring network traffic. They both display the traffic going in and out of the machine and the ports used.

The output you'll see is *jnettop's* (the utilities have rather similar outputs). After running the command:
```bash
$ jnettop
Local <-> Remote
 (IP)                       PORT    PROTO
 (IP)                       PORT
Mihai <-> 2a02:20c:d000:9::d
 2a02:2f0a:b03:10c:d08:8    43543   UDP6
 2a02:20c:d000:9::d           443
   TX       RX      TOTAL
 1.88K/s  303K/s   305K/s
 42.2K    5.32M    5.36M

Mihai <-> 162.125.18.133
 192.168.100.5              34042   TCP
 162.125.18.90                443
 447b/s   218b/s   665b/s
 1.75K     874b    2.60K
 ...
──────────────────────────────────────────
 2.71K/s  304K/s   306K/s
 50.4M    2.24G    2.29G
```
You'll get live updates of in-and-out traffic. Interpreting the output is simple: you've got your IP, port and port type, the remote's IP, port and port type and the upload speed (*TX/transmit*), download speed (*RX/receive*), and the total used for that remote.

You can also sort or filter the output using the flags:
```bash
# only tcp ports, similar to -x
$ jnettop --filter tcp
# traffic through eth0, similar to -i
$ jnettop --interface eth0
# run for 10 seconds
$ jnettop --display text -t 10
```
You might need to run them with *sudo* to work.

## Practice

`jnettop` and `nettop` are tools used to

???


* monitor traffic
* enable and disable ports
* verify how the DNS resolves
* count hops to the remote

---
## Revision

The ??? equivalent of `jnettop` is `nettop`.


* MacOS
* Debian
* Windows
* OpenBSD
