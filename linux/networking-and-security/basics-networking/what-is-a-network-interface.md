# What Is A Network Interface?

---
## Content

Every Linux system has a number of *network interfaces*, each of which corresponds to either a physical or virtual networking device.  For example, if your computer has both an Ethernet card and a Wifi card will have then there will be one network interface for each (by default).

The `ifconfig` command will display a list of network interfaces along with their current status and associated information.  Here is some example output (`...` is used in place of some data to ensure the output fits on screen):

```shell
$ ifconfig
eth0
Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr ...
inet addr:73.14.187.124  Bcast:...  
Mask:255.255.255.0
inet6 addr: .../64 Scope:Global
inet6 addr: .../64 Scope:Link
UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST
   MTU:1500  Metric:1
RX packets:9302745 errors:0 dropped:0 
   overruns:0 frame:0
TX packets:6648291 errors:0 dropped:0 
   overruns:0 carrier:0
collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
RX bytes:995345630 (995.3 MB)
TX bytes:7125692666 (7.1 GB)
$
```

The `eth0` interface corresponds to a physical Ethernet connection.  We can see that the associated connection is active, connected to the internet, and has been assigned an IP address of `73.14.187.124`.  The output includes some high-level network activity statistics: `RX` means corresponds to "received" and `TX` corresponds to "transmitted", i.e., download traffic vs. upload traffic.

## Practice

What interface corresponds to the physical connection?

* eth0
* enp0s3
* lo

## Revision

What do `RX` and `TX` stand for in `ifconfig` â€˜s output? 

???

* Received/Transmitted
* Read/Transmitted
* Read/Translated
