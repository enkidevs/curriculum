# `Firewall` as a service

---
## Content

On BSD and RPM[1] system, the firewall is configured as a service. Therefore, you can switch it on and off using commands that target services and daemons:
```
#for OpenBSD
$ rcctl disable pf
$ rcctl enable pf
#for RedHat 6 and below
$ service iptables stop
$ chkconfig iptables off

$ service iptables start
$ chkconfig iptables on
#the 2nd command ensures that it
#is disabled/enabled on boot
```


On Debian systems, `iptables` is not a service. That means, in order to turn it on and off, you have to run a series of commands, instead of something like `service iptables stop`.

This can be addressed by installing:
```
$ sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
```
You can then stop and start as a service:
```
$ sudo service iptables-persistent stop
$ sudo service iptables-persistent start
```

And save your settings on the fly:

```
$ sudo service
          iptables-persistent save
```

## Footnotes
[1: RHEL7]

It's worth noting that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7) moved on to `firewalld` to manage the firewall, but it still fallbacks to `iptables`.
