# How to clear `iptables` rules

---
## Content

Although it is not a good idea, often we need to make sure that nothing is blocking our 
data from/to a specific host. This can mean the *firewall* needs to be 'disabled'.

On Debian systems, we can issue the following commands as root:

```
$ iptables -F
$ iptables -X
$ iptables -t nat -F
$ iptables -t nat -X
$ iptables -t mangle -F
$ iptables -t mangle -X
$ iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
$ iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
$ iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
```

These commands clear the current custom rules and disable the default ones.

Here:

`-X` flag will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table

`-F` flag is equivalent  to deleting all the rules 

`-t` option targets the table passed as an argument

`-P` flag sets a certain policy (ie `ACCEPT`)

In practice, you might not want to wipe the state clean since it will leave your machine vulnerable.

## Revision

On a Debian system, to stop the firewall you have to ??? the rules.

* clear
* stop
* target
* add
