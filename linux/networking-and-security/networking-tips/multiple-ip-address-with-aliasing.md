# Multiple IP Addresses with aliasing


---

## Content

**IP Aliasing** is assigning multiple IP addresses to a single network interface. This can be useful when hosting multiple SSL sites or to compensate for a host that's down for the moment.

Supposing the primary interface is `eth0` we can set up a *temporary alias* by executing:

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.100.100 up
sudo ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.100.150 up
...
sudo ifconfig eth0:10 192.168.100.250 up
```

To make this permanent we need to edit network config files. 

In Debian based system we edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` and we add:

```bash
auto eth0:0
iface eth0:0 inet static
        address 192.168.100.100
        netmask 255.255.255.0

```

In Red Hat based systems, first copy existing card configuration `ifcfg-eth0` from:

```bash
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
```

into

```bash
new/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
```

as `ifcfg-eth0:1`.

Then, edit the `DEVICE` and `IPADDR` directives like below:

```plain-text
DEVICE="eth0:1"
...
IPADDR=192.168.100.100
```

## Revision

To temporary alias `eth0` interface as `eth0:1` you would run:

```bash
??? ??? ??? 
  100.100.100.1  ???
```

- `sudo`
- `ifconfig`
- `eth0:1`
- `up`
- `eth0`
- `ACTIVE`
