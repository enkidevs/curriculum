# Stress testing with `ab`

---
## Content

ApacheBench (or `ab` tool) is a tool for benchmarking and regression testing of web servers.

The simplest test you can do is to perform 1000 requests, 10 at a time (which approximately simulates 10 concurrent users getting 100 pages each - over the length of the test).

```
$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 -k \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" \
  http://www.example.com/
```

`-n` 1000 is the number of requests.

`-c 10` tells `ab` to do 10 requests at a time, instead of 1 request at a time, to better simulate concurrent visitors (vs. sequential visitors).

`-k` sends the `KeepAlive` header, which asks the web server to reuse connections.

`-H` appends an extra header to the request. The argument should be a valid header line.
