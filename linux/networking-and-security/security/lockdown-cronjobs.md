# Lockdown **Cronjobs**

---
## Content

`cron`, the system process used to *schedule* tasks has a built-in feature that let's you determine who may or who may not run jobs with it.

There are two files in charge of this:
 - `/etc/cron.allow`
 - `/etc/cron.deny`

You can add usernames to `cron.deny` as to lock them from using `cron`.

To allow a user to run `cron` you need to add its username to `cron.allow`.

You can also disable all users from using `cron` by adding `ALL` to the former file:
```
$ echo ALL >>/etc/cron.deny
```
*Note*: If the *cron.allow* file exists, only users specified in that file can use cron, and *cron.deny* file is ignored.

---
## Practice

Disable `cron` access for every user:
```
$ ??? ???>>/etc/???
```

* `echo`
* `ALL`
* `cron.deny`
* `allow`
* `deny`
* `cron.lock`
* `cron.allow`
* `DISABLE`
* `ls`

---
## Revision

You can deny users access to *cronjobs* by adding them to 

???.

* /etc/cron.deny
* /etc/cron.allow
* /crontab/deny
* /cron/.deny
