# Debugging `ssh` client issues


---

## Content

To see more detailed information when connecting to a host via ssh for debugging purposes, add the `-v` flag (for verbosity):   

```bash
ssh -v user@host.corp.com
```

This will display a variety of useful information about the connection.

OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012
```

```plain-text
