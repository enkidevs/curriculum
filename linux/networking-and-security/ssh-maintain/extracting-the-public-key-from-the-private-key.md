# Extracting the `public key` from the `private key`

---
## Content

The `-y` option of the `ssh-keygen` tool outputs the public key:
```
$ ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa \ 
> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Here, the `-f` flag specifies the *input keyfile* - `~/.ssh/id_rsa` - the private key file.

The output is *redirected* to the public key file, `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

A truncated example of a public key:
```
ssh-rsa AAAA..../VqDjtS5 user@pc
```
The *public key* can then be used as a way to connect through SSH, only that the user has to prove it has the paired *private key* or the server won't allow access.

## Revision

Extract the *public key* from your *private ssh key*:
```
$ ??? ??? ??? 
          ???
```

* `ssh-keygen`
* `-y`
* `-f`
* `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
* `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
* `-p`
* `cat`
