# Setting up password-free authentication

---
## Content

To set up password-free authentication start by generating a pair of keys:
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the
             key (~/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```
After you choose a path and a password, you can see the generated key by running:
```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
All is left to do is to copy your key to the server:
```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub |
    ssh user@hostname 'cat >>
       ~/.ssh/authorized_keys &&
       chmod 700 ~/.ssh/ &&
       chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```
The command will make you connect to the server, paste your key into the *authorized_keys* file on the server and ensure that you are the only one who can access the file by setting up permissions.

The permission part is necessary, otherwise the server won't recognize your key when trying to connect.

You will then be able to log in without introducing a password:
```
$ ssh user@hostname
```
Some distributions may have the `ssh-copy-id` utility that makes the process easier:
```
$ ssh-copy-id user@hostname
```

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet such that, by running it, a SSH `rsa` key pair is generated:
```
$ ??? -t ???
```


* `ssh-keygen`
* `rsa`
* `ssh`
* `keygen`
* `sshKeygen`
* `generate`
* `ssh-rsa`
* `public`
* `private`
* `--pair`

## Revision

The file on the server in which to add your ssh key to set up password-less authentication is

???

* `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
* `~/ssh/authorized_keys`
* `~/ssh/keys`
