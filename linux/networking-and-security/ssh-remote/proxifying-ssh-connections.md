## Content

Since connection to a server is usually achieved by:

```
$ ssh user@box
```

An interesting feature of the ssh client is neglected:

```
$ ssh user@box 'ls -la /tmp'
total 4
drwxrwxrwt  4 root root   80 Jun ...
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 May ...
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root   40 Apr ...
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root   40 Apr ...
```
This executes the command on the remote server and gets the output directly from there.

This allows a user to log in to a remote host using another host as below:

```
$ ssh -t hostB 'ssh hostC'
```
If `w` (who) is issued on hostC, hostB would appear in the `FROM` field.


The `-t` option is mandatory in this case to force pseudo-terminal allocation and be able to work in an interactive shell. If you intend to run a non-interactive command like `ls` or `cat` it's possible to omit the `-t` option:

```
$ ssh hostB ssh hostC 'ls -lah'
```

## Revision

If you are using a middle server to connect to a third, what username will appear on the third server’s connections list?

???
*the middle server’s username
*your username
*the third server’s username
