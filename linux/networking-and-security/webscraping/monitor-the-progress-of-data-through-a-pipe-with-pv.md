# Monitor the progress of data through a pipe with `pv`

## Content

Use `pv` to watch the progress and speed of a `cp`:
```
$ pv my_big_file > backup/my_big_file
```
This method will lose the file's permissions and ownership. 

Files copied this way will have the same permissions as if you'd created them yourself.

In this example, `pv` outputs the file to `stdout*`, which you redirect to a file using the `>` operator. Simultaneously, it prints information about the progress to the terminal.

```
$ pv my_big_file > backup/my_big_file
 138MB 0:00:01 [73.3MB/s] [========>] 100% 
```
You may need to install `pv` package on your system.
