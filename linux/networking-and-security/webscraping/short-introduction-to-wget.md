# Short Introduction to `Wget` 

---
## Content

`Wget` is a utility that can work better than a browser when it comes to downloading pages or files from the web and even for synchronizing local web archives. 

It's really easy and straightforward to download a file specified by a **URL**:
```
$ wget http://localhost/myfile.tar.gz
```

A limitation of `wget` is that when a page uses **HTTP** protocols and not **FTP**, it does not support wildcard.

`wget` is most often used to mirror a website:
```
$ wget --mirror -p --html-extension \
--convert-links http://localhost
```

After the transfer has finished, `wget` goes through the local files to change any remote references so the site can be viewed **offline**.
