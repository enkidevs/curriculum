# Check the version of a package on a Debian based system

---
## Content

You can check the version of a package installed in a deb based system with the `dpkg` command:

```
$ dpkg --list <package>
```

```
$ dpkg --list python
    Name      Version        Description
ii  python    2.7.3-0ubuntu2 interact..
```
The first column represents the *status* of the package. It is made up of 3 letters, the third one being used in case of an error.

The first one refers to the *desired* state of the package, or how is supposed to be. In this case, `i` means the package is marked for installation. Other options are:
```
u: Unknown
r: Remove
p: Purge
h: Hold
```

The second character stands for its actual status: the package is installed because it reads an `i`. Other posibilities are:
```
n: Not-installed
c: Conf-files are present
u: Unpacked
f: Fail-conf(conf removal failed)
h: Half-installed
w: trig-aWait from another package
t: Trig-pend (has beed triggered)
```
The only option for third letter is `r` and means it needs reinstallation (reinst-required).

## Practice

A status code of `uf` stands for 

???.

* unknown desired state and removal of the config files failed state
* unmount desired state and removal of the config files failed state
* unknown desired state and half installed state
* installed desired state and unknown state
