# Install specific version of packages

---
## Content

Often it's necessary to install a specific version of a package. To do so, a complete version of the package is required.

This will be displayed when we run:
```
#debian
$ apt-cache showpkg <package_name>
Package: firefox
Versions:
47.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.1


#rpm
$ yum --showduplicates list
                    <package_name>
Available Packages   
firefox   46.0   fedora
firefox   47.0   updates
```
This will output different versions that our sources provide.

To install the specific version simply run:
```
#debian
$ apt-get install <package_name>=<version>
#rpm
$ yum install <package_name>-<version>
```
For example:
```
$ apt-get install firefox=46.0
```
