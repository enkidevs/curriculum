# List installed packages

---
## Content

We can get a list of all the installed packages on a Debian / Ubuntu server by issuing:

```
$ sudo dpkg --get-selections
```
On RPM systems:
```
$ yum list installed
```
On BSD systems:
```
$ pkg_version
```
It is good practice to save this file as it can be useful when migrating, so we pipe it into a file:
```
$ dpkg --get-selections > ~/package_list
 #yum list installed
 #pkg_version
```
To search for a specific package run:
```
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep <package>
$ yum list installed "package_name"
```

## Practice

Itâ€™s good practice to add the list of installed packages to a new file because 

???.

* it makes the recovery process easier
* it is easier to list them again
* it is easier to update them

---
## Revision

Match each OS with its command for listing installed packages:
```
#???
$ dpkg --get-selections
#???
$ rpm -qa 
#???
$ pkg_version 
```

* `Debian`
* `RedHat/Fedora`
* `BSD`
