# Backporting on Debian

---
## Content

Backports are recompiled packages, taken from the next Debian releases (from *testing* and sometimes from *unstable*, when it comes to security updates) installed on a *stable* environment.

Backporting should be used with care, as upgrading packages you don't understand can have unintended effects on your system.
 
Therefore, selecting single required backported packages is recommended over using all available backports.

To use this feature in `wheezy`, add this line in `sources.list`[1]:
```
deb http://http.debian.net/debian \
  wheezy-backports main
```

Then, update the package list:
```
$ apt-get update
```

Install a package from the backport using:
```
$ apt-get -t jessie-backports
                   install "package"
```

Or:
```
$ aptitude -t jessie-backports 
                   install "package"
```

The `-t` (`--target-release`) specifies *jessie-backports* as target release.

## Footnotes
[1:Syntax]
`deb` indicates that the archive contains binary packages, next is the repository URL. The *distribution* can be either the release code name(i.e. wheezy-backports) or release class(stable,testing). `main` is a *component* and consists of *DFSG*(Debian Free Software Guidelines)-compilant packages, which are considered being part of the Debian distribution.
