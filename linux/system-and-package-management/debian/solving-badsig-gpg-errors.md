# Solving `BADSIG GPG` errors

---
## Content

When installing a package a GPG error regarding bad signature may occur. Usually, this happens because your signatures are incorect.

```
W: GPG error: 
http://download.virtualbox.org 
lucid Release:  
The following signatures were invalid:
BADSIG 54422A4B98AB5139 Oracle
Corporation key
```

If you trust the source's key fingerprint, copy the string after `BADSIG` and use it to run the following:
```
$ sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys \ 
  --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
 54422A4B98AB5139
```
The installation operation should now succeed.
