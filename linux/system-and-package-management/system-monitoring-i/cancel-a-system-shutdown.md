# Cancel a system shutdown

---
## Content

If you started the shutdown either via the terminal or from the GUI and then realised that you didnâ€™t really want to do that, you can use:

```
$ shutdown -c
```
However, note that if the shutdown has already started, it may be too late to cancel it.

Another command to try is :
```
$ pkill shutdown
```
