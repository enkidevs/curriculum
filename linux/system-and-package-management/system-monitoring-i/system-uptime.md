## Content

In Linux, the `uptime` standard command shows information regarding how long your system is running, but also how many users are currently logged in.

Run uptime:
```
$ uptime
12:59  up  2:26, 2 users, \
 load averages: 1.19 2.45 4.34
```

- The current time is `12:59`.
- The uptime is `2:26` (hours).
- `2` users are logged in.
- The load averages for the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes are `1.19`, `2.45` and `4.34`.

To display just the uptime:
```
$ uptime -p
```
Display last time the system restarted:
```
$ uptime -s
```
