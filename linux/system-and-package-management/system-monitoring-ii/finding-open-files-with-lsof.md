# Finding Open Files With `lsof`

---
## Content

The `lsof`[1] command displays a list of currently open files and the program that has opened it.  There are two common scenarios where `lsof` is incredibly useful:

1. You have a specific program in mind and want to know what files it's using, e.g., you're not sure where a program's configuration files live.
2. You have a specific file in mind and want to know what programs are using it, e.g., some program is overwriting a file but you don't know which one.

In order to see every file and every process you have to have `root` permission, otherwise you will only be able to see files opened by processes you've started or have permission to see.

### Finding Files By Process

If you know the name of a process and want to see which files it has open, you can use the `-p` option, like so:

```shell
$ sudo lsof -p 3164
COMMAND  PID  ...  NAME
mysqld  3164  ... /var/lib/mysql
$
```

We've truncated the output here for illustration purposes.

### Finding Processes By File

If you know the name of a specific file and want to know which processes have it open, you can pass in the name of the file directly, like so:

```shell
$ sudo lsof /var/log/syslog
```

## Practice

???

flag is required to find files used by a specific process.


* -p
* -f
* -r
* -pr

## Revision

You can find *all* the processes that are using a file by issuing:
```
$ ??? ??? ???
```

* `sudo`
* `lsof`
* `filename`
* `proc`
* `ls -apl`

## Footnotes
[1:lsof]
You can think of `lsof` as ls + of ,standing for **list** *open files*.
