# List currently logged in users

---
## Content

It is possible to check if other people are working on a server or machine you are using.

To do this, use the `w` command:
```bash
$ w
```
Running this will output a list of users currently working on the machine as well as their processes.

To find information about a specific user just add its name as an argument:
```bash
$ w enki
```

On *Linux* you can also use the `-s` flag[1] to **short**-print the output such that some columns are dropped[2]:
```bash
$ w -s
19:34:06 up 67 days, 21:26,  2 users,
          load average: 0.09, 0.13, 0.13
 USER     TTY    FROM         IDLE   WHAT
 root     pts/0  10.92.42.138 3:23   nano
             /etc/dnsmasq.d/sede.conf
 root     pts/1  10.92.42.138 0.00s  -bash
```
Both the IP from where that user is logged from and what they are doing (in this case editing the dns config file) are returned.

## Practice

Find information about a user named `tom`:
```bash
$ ??? ???
```


* `w`
* `tom`
* `-s`
* `enki`
* `ls`
* `user`
* `find`

---
## Revision

To check if other people are connected to a server you are using, you could run 

??? .


* w
* ssh users
* ssh -u
* ssh -w

## Footnotes
[1:Tip]
Other flags can be used as well:
- `-h` won't print the header
- `-u` ignores current process name
- `-f` shows remote hostname field
- `-o` will use old style output

[2:Additional Information]
Other columns printed by `w` command include `JCPU` and `PCPU` time.
