# Basic service management with `systemd`

---
## Content

In Ubuntu `upstart` will be deprecated in favor of `systemd`. Here is what you can do with it.

For each service unit, this command displays its full name followed by a note whether the unit has been loaded, its high-level and low-level unit activation state, and a short description[1]:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type service
                               --all

```
Use the following to start a service. Does not persist after reboot:

```bash 
systemctl start SERVICE.service
```

Use this to stop a service. Does not persist after reboot:
```bash
systemctl stop SERVICE.service
```
Use the following to restart a service:

```bash
systemctl restart SERVICE.service
```
If the service supports it, this will reload the config files related to it without interrupting any process that is using the service:

```bash
systemctl reload SERVICE.service
```
The next command shows the status of a service and whether or not a service is currently running:

```bash
systemctl status SERVICE.service
```
To start a service on boot, use:
```bash
systemctl enable SERVICE.service
``` 

And to stop it from starting on boot:
```bash
systemctl disable SERVICE.service
```
