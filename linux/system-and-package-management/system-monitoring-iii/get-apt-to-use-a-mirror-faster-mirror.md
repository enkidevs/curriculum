# Get `apt` to use a mirror / faster mirror

---
## Content

`apt-get` now supports a 'mirror' method that will automatically select a good mirror based on your location. 

The format is (in one line):
```
deb
<repo link>
<distro>
<selection1,2..n>

```
Putting the following lines one by one would be:
```
deb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt 
precise 
main restricted universe multiverse

deb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt 
precise-updates 
main restricted universe multiverse

deb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt 
precise-backports 
main restricted universe multiverse

deb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt 
precise-security 
main restricted universe multiverse
```

on the top in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file should be all that is needed to make it automatically pick a mirror for you based on your geographical location.

Lucid (10.04), Maverick (10.10), Natty (11.04), And Oneiric (11.10) users can replace precise with the appropriate name.
