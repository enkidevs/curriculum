# Changing the `/tmp` cleanup frequency

---
## Content

The `/tmp` directory is cleared by default at every boot as the `TMPTIME` in `/etc/default/rcS` is 0 by default.

`TMPTIME` says how frequently (in days) the `tmp` directory should be cleared. 

`TMPTIME=7` would allow files to stay in /tmp until they are a week old, and then be deleted on the next reboot. 

A negative number `TMPTIME=-1` tells the system to never delete anything in /tmp.

*Be careful* as deleting /tmp blindly may also delete files that are being used by running programs.

Yet, for servers that rarely reboot, setting up an entry in the `crontab` may be necessary:

```
$ crontab -e
```
Add:
```
0 5 * * 1 rm -rf /tmp/*
```
This would clear `tmp` every weekend at 5 AM.

## Practice

A negative value of `TMPTIME`  tells the system to delete the tmp folder
