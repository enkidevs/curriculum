# CPU benchmark with `dd`

---
## Content

`dd` in conjunction with any stream-processing CPU-intensive program can also be used as a simple CPU benchmark! You can run this out of the box as follows:
```
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | md5sum
```
In this case the `md5sum` program was used, which calculates the MD5 hash of data that is fed to it. 

In effect, `dd` here fetches 1 GB of zeroes from the Linux kernel, feeds that to `md5sum`, and then prints how fast in `MB/sec` that was processed. So for example on a modern 3.6 GHz AMD Phenom II CPU:
```
$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | md5sum
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 
2.28735 s, 469 MB/s

## Revision

As a hack for bench-testing the computerâ€™s CPU you can use:
```
$ ??? if=/dev/zero bs=1M 
         count=1024 | ???
```

* `dd`
* `md5sum`
* `db`
* `md5s`
