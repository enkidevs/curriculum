# Executing scripts on system boot using `systemd`

---
## Content

Since most of the distributions migrated to `systemd`, the old way of running a script on boot by adding it to the `rc.local` won't be supported for long.

Now, to run a script on boot, you have to create a new file in `/etc/systemd/system` and add the following contents:
```
[Unit]
Description=My script

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/myscript

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
The name of the file should be something like `myscript.service`. Then, you have to enable the new service to start on system boot:
```
$ systemctl enable myscript.service
```
You might also have to set execute permission for the script to work:
```
$ chmod 755 myscript.service
```
