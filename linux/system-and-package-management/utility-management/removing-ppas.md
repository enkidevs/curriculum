# Removing PPAs

---
## Content

*Personal Package Archives* are non-standard updates or pieces of software (think of unstable versions). If you decide to delete them, there are multiple ways in which to do so.

Using the `--remove` flag:
```
$ add-apt-repository --remove ppa:name/ppa
```

Or, as a safer alternative, you can install `ppa-purge`:
```
$ apt-get install ppa-purge
```

And then remove the PPA while gracefully downgrading packages it provided to packages provided by official repositories:

```
$ ppa-purge ppa_name
```

This will remove the PPA but it will not uninstall packages that were installed through it. If you want to remove them, you should use 
`apt`:
```
$ apt-get purge package_name
```

You can also remove PPAs by deleting the .list files from `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory and then updating the repositories 
by: 
```
$ apt-get update
```

## Practice

The safer alternative to `apt-get purge` that also removes PPAâ€™s is 

???.

* ppa-purge
* add-apt-repository --remove
* manually deleting their list files

## Revision

```
$ ??? ??? ???
```

* `apt-get`
* `purge`
