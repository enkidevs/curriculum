# What is a PPA?

---
## Content

**PPA**s, or *Personal Package Archives*, is a software repository for *APT*[1] packages, hosted on `launchpad.net` servers[2]. *PPAs* are used for distributing software written or maintained by a private group or individual (anyone can publish).

Packages from those *PPA*s can be downloaded both through a *shell* and a *GUI interface*. As they can be written by anyone in the community, there are a few points to consider:
 - Who created the PPA
 - How many user have downloaded and used it
 - How up to date it is (what OS version it runs on)

In order to list all the installed **PPAs** run the following on the shell:
```
$ grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
```
