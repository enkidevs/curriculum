standards:
  file-management:
    name: Manage files via the command line
    description: This standard deals with creation and deletion of files, renaming files, traversing the file system, and complex file operations such as appending text or tailing a file.
    objectives:
      0: Traverse the file system with cd
      1: Analyze directories with ls
      2: Create files with touch
      3: Create directories with mkdir
      4: Move or rename files with mv
      5: Copy files with cp
      6: Delete files with rm
      7: Delete directories with rmdir
      8: Output a file's contents to stdout with cat
      9: Append to a file
      10: Watch a file with tail
      11: Distinguish relative file paths from absolute file paths
  configure-shell:
    name: Configure your shell
    description: This standard covers configuration of shell behavior and display using built-in unix tools as well as external tools.
    objectives:
      0: Change the colors of your terminal
      1: Add data to your terminal's line
      2: Change your display name
      3: Change your shell
      4: Add startup scripts and environment variables by modifying shell lifecycle configuration scripts
  environment-variables:
    name: Set and use environment variables
    description: This standard covers the use of user-local and system environment variables.
    objectives:
      0: Inspect environment variables in your shell
      1: Set environment variables manually
      2: Set environment variables with a shell script, like .bash_rc

      4: Use environment variables in a shell script
  standard-streams-pipelines:
    name: Direct program input and output using stdin, stdout, pipes and redirection
    description: This standard covers file input and output descriptors, the standard streams, stdin, stdout, stderr, and their manipulation through pipelines.
    objectives:
      0: Distinguish the purpose and output of the standard streams
      1: Redirect stdout to a file
      2: Use the stdout of one program as the stdin for another program with a pipe
      3: Direct stdout and stderr to different places
      4: Tail a stderr and stdout log in two terminal windows
      5: Use pipes to direct data through multiple programs
  users-permissions:
    name: Manage users and their permissions
    description: This standard covers user management and the granting of privileges, and creation and management of groups.

    objectives:
      0: Evaluate the read, write and execution permissions of a file using POSIX-compliant permissions
      1: Grant or restrict read, write, and execute permissions to users and groups
      2: Determine the appropriate permissions for a file
      3: Manage the ownership of a file

    name: Write shell expressions
    description: This standard covers the use of simple unix programs typically available in your shell to perform operations on data.
    objectives:
      0: Use simple unix programs such as expr to operate on numerical values
      1: Use simple unix programs such as cat and grep to operate on string values
      2: Compose simple unix programs to produce strings or numerical values
