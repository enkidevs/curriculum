# Adding directories to your 

`$PATH`


---

## Content

**PATH** is an environmental variable that informs the shell within which directories to search for executable files in response to commands issued by a user.

To do this, edit the `.bashrc` file in the home directory and append the following line (chaining the existing path additions) :

```bash
export PATH=/path/to/dir:$PATH
```

You can open *.bashrc* in terminal by running:

```bash
$ nano ~/.bashrc
# ~/ being the implicit path for
# your home folder
```

For example, to add the directory */usr/sbin*, the following would be used:

```bash
PATH="/usr/sbin:$PATH"
```

Source your .bashrc or logout/login (or restart the terminal) for the changes to take effect.

Sourcing executes the file that it was given as a parameter.  To source your *.bashrc*, simply type

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

This is the same as running:

```bash
. ~/.bashrc
```
