## Content

**PATH** is an environmental variable that informs the shell within which directories to search for executable files in response to commands issued by a user.

To do this, edit the `.bashrc` file in the home directory and append the following line (chaining the existing path additions) :
```
export PATH=/path/to/dir:$PATH
```
You can open *.bashrc* in terminal by running:
```
$ nano ~/.bashrc
# ~/ being the implicit path for
# your home folder
```

For example, to add the directory */usr/sbin*, the following would be used:
```
PATH="/usr/sbin:$PATH"
```

Source your .bashrc or logout/login (or restart the terminal) for the changes to take effect.

Sourcing executes the file that it was given as a parameter.  To source your *.bashrc*, simply type
```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
This is the same as running:
```
. ~/.bashrc
```
