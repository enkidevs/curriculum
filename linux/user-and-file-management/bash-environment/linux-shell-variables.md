# Variables


---

## Content

Think of a *variable* as a box. 

They are used to store information. To make them easily identifiable, you put a label on them. 

Let's try creating a variable now:

```bash
best_app="Enki"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Don't add any spaces around the `=` sign or you'll get an error saying `"Command not found"`.

We've taken the `"Enki"` information, and stored it in our `best_app` box:

![variable-mental-model](https://img.enkipro.com/fa537341f3027f1cea7b76ecc3398e9d.png)

To print this variable, you'd type:

```bash
echo $best_app
# Enki
```

> ðŸ’¡ You need to prefix a `$` sign to the variable name to get its value

```bash
echo best_app
# best_app
```

## Practice

Create a variable named `good_dog` that stores `"Artemis"`, and then print it:

```bash
???="???"
echo ???
# Artemis
```

- good_dog
- Artemis
- $good_dog
- $Artemis

## Revision

Which of these variable declarations will throw an error?

```bash
a="foobar"

b = foobar

c=foobar
```

???

- b
- a
- c
