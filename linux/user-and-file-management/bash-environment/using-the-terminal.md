# Using the Terminal


---

## Content

Before we go on, let's open the terminal. *All computers come with a default terminal*.

There are a few ways of doing this:

- pressing `CTRL + ALT + T` (Ubuntu specific)
- right-click anywhere in a directory/desktop and press `Open terminal`
- press the `Super` key (AKA the `Windows` key) and search for `terminal`

Now that it's open, go ahead and type:

```bash
echo "Enki is cool!"
```

You should see the text display in the terminal:

```plain-text
Enki is cool! 
```

If that was your first Linux command, congratulations 🎉🎉. 

With `echo`, any string that you pass as an argument will be printed in the shell.

> 💡 Although quotation marks (`"`) are optional, it's recommended to use them. If you omit them, the shell might misunderstand your command.
