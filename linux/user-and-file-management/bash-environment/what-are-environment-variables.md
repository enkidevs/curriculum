# Environment Variables

---
## Content

An *environment variable* is a variable that is available to all the processes running in the shell.

> ðŸ’¡ You can think of environment variables like global variables.

Linux contains many default environment variables.

> ðŸ’¡ Environment variables are usually named with all uppercase letters to differentiate them from regular variables.

As an example, the `HOME` environment variable holds the current user's home directory.

> ðŸ’¡ A "directory" is just another name for a folder.

Use the `env` command to see a list of all current environment variables:

```bash
env
# USER=enki
# HOME=/home/enki
# ... (potentially many lines)
```

If you know the name of the variable you're looking for, use the `echo` command to display it:

```shell
echo $HOME
# /home/enki
```

## Practice

Display a list of all the current environment variables:

```bash
???
# USER=enki
# HOME=/home/enki
# ...
```

* env
* $env
* environment
* $environment

---
## Revision

Print the value of the environmental variable `HOME` : 
```bash
??? ???
```

* `echo`
* `$HOME`
* `home`
* `$home`
* `ls`
