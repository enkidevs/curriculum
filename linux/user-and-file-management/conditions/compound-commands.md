# The `((` and `[[` Compound Commands

---
## Content

While `test` does a good job at evaluating expressions, requiring different operators for strings and integers comparison can be cumbersome to use.

The `(( expression ))` command evaluates an arithmetic expression and returns *1* if expression evaluates to *0*, and *0* otherwise. The advantage of using this command is that you don't have to escape the characters:
```bash
$ (( 1 == 2 )) && echo true || echo false
# false
$ (( 4/2 - 2 )); echo $?
# 1
```
On the other hand, `[[ expression ]]` allows you to combine tests that are allowed for the `test` command (same syntax, comprising files, strings or integers):
```bash
# regex matching
$ [[ "abc de" == a[bc]*\ d* || \
    (( 2 > 1 )) ]]; echo $?
# 0
$ [[ 3 -gt 2 ]]; echo $?
# 0
```
And also files:
```bash
$ [[ -w $HOME || 2 > 1 ]] && echo "true"
#  true
```

## Practice

What type of expression can go between `[[ ]]`?

???


* Any expressions that `test` also accepts
* Only string comparison expressions
* Only arithmetic expressions
* Any type expression

---
## Revision

Which of the following statements about `(( ))` is false?
```
1. It accepts only arithmetic exceptions
2. Operators like > and < have to be escaped
3. The equal sign (=) represents assignment
```
???


* 2
* 1
* 3
* none
