# Sequential execution using the `;` statement separator

---
## Content

The `;` separator makes it possible to specify several commands all at once, the shell executing them sequentially: 

```
$ date ; uname ; clear
Fri 11 May 12:21:23 BST 2016
Linux
# then clear would delete the text
# in the terminal
```

---
## Practice

Run the following commands one after the other :
```
$ date ??? who am i
```

* `;`
* `\n`
* `||`

---
## Revision

You can sequentially run commands using the ??? statement separator.


* ;
* ’’
* &
* &&
