Previously, you've seen the `&&` and `||` operators that have different results based on whether other commands were successful or not. The `test` built-in allows us to evaluate expressions and, therefore, to have a different approach to using `&&` and `||`.

The syntax is as follows:
```bash
$ test expression
# or
$ [ expression ]
```
While the first option should work in most shells, the second one doesn't work in *zsh* for example.

The command returns **0** if the `expression` evaluates to *false* and **1** otherwise. The `[` **command** must take `]` as its last argument. For example, here are some simple tests you can perform:
```bash
$ test 1 -lt 2 && echo true || echo false
# true
```
`test` has a number of conditional flags, some of which are:
 - `-e FILE`: true if *FILE* exists
 - `-d FILE`: true if *FILE* exists and is a directory
 - `-x FILE`: true if *FILE* exists and is executable
 - `-z STRING`: true if *STRING* is empty
 - `STRING1 \< STRING2`: true if *STRING1* sorts before *STRING2* (in ASCII; `=, \>` are also available)
 - `INT1 -eq INT2`: true if *INT1* is equal to *INT2* (`-ne, -lt, -le, -gt, -ge` are also available)
 - `!TEST`: true if *TEST* is false

Another example:
```bash
$ [ 1 \< 2 ] && [ "abc" = "abc" ]; echo $?
# 1
```
As you can see, `\<` must be escaped when using `[]`. `$?` is used to get the return value, hence the printed `1`.

There are also flags that replicate the functionality of `&&` (`-a`) and `||` (`-o`), but their use is *ill-advised*.

## Practice

Fill in the gaps for the following snippet to make sense:
```bash
$ touch script.sh
$ test ??? script.sh && echo "created"
# created
$ chmod +x script.sh
$ test ??? script.sh && echo "executable"
# executable
```
* `-e`
* `-x`
* `-ex`
* `-d`
* `-z`

## Revision

The equivalent syntax for the `test <expr>` command is

???

* `[ <expr> ]`
* `[<expr>]`
* `(( <expr> ))`
* `$(<expr>)`
* `!<expr>`
