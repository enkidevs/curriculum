# Making a file unalterable with `chattr`

---
## Content

You can make a file unalterable so that it cannot be changed or deleted even by root:

```bash
sudo chattr +i /path/to/file
```

After that the file becomes *untouchable*.

To make it alterable again, remove the attribute using `-i` flag:

```bash
sudo chattr -i /path/to/file
```

Use the `-R` flag to unlock a directory.

```bash
sudo chattr -R -i directory/
```

The Mac equivalent is:

```bash
# to "lock" the file
chflags uchg /path/to/file
# to "unlock"
chflags nouchg /path/to/file
```
