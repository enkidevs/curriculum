# Easy way of sharing files

---
## Content

File transfer on the network without setting up extra software can be easily achieved using `woof` utility.

`woof` (Web Offer One File) is a script and will run on any machine with *Python* installed.
 
It can be downloaded at: `www.home.unix-ag.org/ simon/woof.html`.

To share a file:
```
$ ./woof /directory/file

```
This will give you a **URL** that can be typed in a browser and the download will begin.

You can also share directories:
```
$ ./woof -z /directory/
```
This will compress the directory into a **gzipped** tarball.

You can also share `woof` itself:
```
$ ./woof -s
```
