## Content

Delete files in a relatively secure way using `shred`. 

It is obtainable through the installation of `coreutils` (Ubuntu has it preinstalled). `shred` securely erases and overwrites single files with the `Gutmann`[1] method. 

Fast shredding:
```
$ sudo shred -vzn 0 /dir/file
```

The above will overwrite the *file* with 0s in a single iteration. 

Secure shredding:
```
$ sudo shred -vzn 3 /dir/file
```
The shredding process is repeated 3 times,  using random numbers. 

In addition, option `-z` writes zeros to hide the shredding process at the end. This will take 4 times longer than the fast method.

Shredding efficiently deletes everything including file system caches in case of a partition. It can also be used to remove unwanted remnants of deleted files.

## Practice

Use shred to delete `old_folder` , in 2 iterations, without hiding the shredding process:
```
$ ??? ??? ??? ??? 
                 ~/old_folder
```
*`sudo`
*`shred`
*`-n`
*`2`
*`-zn`
*`-fz`
*`rm`

## Revision

??? .

[1:Gutmann Method]
An algorithm for secure deletion of files. It involves overwriting to-be-deleted data with 35 patterns of bits so it cannot be recovered.
