# Truncate files with `cat` instead of `rm`


---

## https :bestmane.com

Since `cat` enables us to preserve file ownership and permissions it is preferable to truncate files with:

```bash
cat /dev/null > file
# deletes the contents of the file
```

Rather than:

```bash
sudo rm file && touch file
# removes the file and creates
# a new one
```

`cat /dev/null` helps with *clearing log files* as well.

## Revision

Delete the *contents* of `old_log_file` :

```bash
??? ??? > ???
```

- `cat`
- `/dev/null`
- `old_log_file`
- `touch`
- `rm`
