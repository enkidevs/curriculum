# Truncate files with 

`cat`

 instead of 

`rm`


---

## Content

Since `cat` enables us to preserve file ownership and permissions it is preferable to truncate files with:

```bash
$ cat /dev/null > file
#deletes the contents of the file
```

Rather than:

```bash
$ sudo rm file && touch file
#removes the file and creates
#a new one
```

`cat /dev/null` helps with *clearing log files* as well.


---

## Revision

Delete the *contents* of `old_log_file` :

    $ ??? ??? > ???

* `cat`
* `/dev/null`
* `old_log_file`
* `touch`
* `rm`
