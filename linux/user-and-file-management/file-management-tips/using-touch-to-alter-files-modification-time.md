# Using 

`touch`

 to alter files modification time


---

## Content

You can change the modification time of a file using the touch command:

```bash
$ touch filename
```

By default, this will set the file's modification time to the current time. However, there are a number of flags, such as the `-d` flag to pick a particular date. 

For example, to set a file as being modified two hours before the present:

```bash
$ touch -d "2 hours ago" filename
```

If you want to modify the file relative to its existing modification time instead:

```bash
$ touch -d "$(date -r file) - 2 hours" file
```

This might not work on BSD systems.

* `"5 minutes ago"`
* `5`
* `-r`
* `set`
