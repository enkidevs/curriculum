# More about `chmod`

---
## Content

Besides having characters to denote who gets what permissions, `chmod` allows us to use digits as well.

Different digits in `chmod` mean a different set of permissions. The digits we can use and their meaning are shown below:

```
0: (000) no permission.
1: (001) execute permission.
2: (010) write permission.
3: (011) write and execute permissions.
4: (100) read permission.
5: (101) read and execute permissions.
6: (110) read and write permissions.
7: (111) read, write, and execute permissions.
```

These digits are then combined to denote permissions for the owner, groups, and other.

Some commonly used permissions examples for executable files:

```sh
# all three have no restrictions
chmod 777 filename

# owner has no restrictions
chmod 700 filename
```

For general files:

```sh
# all users can read/write the file
chmod 666 filename

# above is the same as
chmod a+rw filename
```

## Practice

Add *read/execute* permissions for *user* and *other* for enki.txt: 
```
??? ??? ?????? enki.txt
```

* `chmod`
* `uo`
* `+`
* `rx`
* `ug`
* `a`
* `-`
