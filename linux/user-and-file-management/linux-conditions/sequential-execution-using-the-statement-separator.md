# Sequential execution using the `;` statement separator


---

## Content

The `;` separator makes it possible to specify several commands all at once, the shell executing them sequentially: 

```bash
date ; uname ; clear
Fri 11 May 12:21:23 BST 2016
Linux
# then clear would delete the text
# in the terminal
```


---

## Practice

Run the following commands one after the other :

```bash
date ??? whoami
```

- `;`
- `\n`
- `||`


---

## Revision

You can sequentially run commands using the ??? statement separator.

- `;`
- `’’`
- `&`
- `&&`
