# Hello Linux

## Content

All this talk, and we still haven't shown you how to use Linux 😅.

> 💡 We're going to assume you have an installed Linux distribution. If you don't, check out the *Learn More* section for Ubuntu installation guides.

This is the Linux terminal[1]! It's where you'll be typing most of the commands.

What you see in the example is how to use the `echo` command to display some text.

> 💡 We'll explain how printing works in the next workout.

A **command** is just a piece of text that you type into the **terminal**. Think of this as an instruction that you give to your computer.

The main part of the terminal that reads the commands and executes them is called a **shell**.

## Footnotes

[1:Terminal]
Similarly to how you can use a mouse to tell the computer to open a file, you can also type in a command in the **terminal**. 

From opening files to increasing the computer volume, there's a terminal command for anything the computer can do.

The term "terminal" originates from the first computers, which had a physical terminal that was used to communicate.
