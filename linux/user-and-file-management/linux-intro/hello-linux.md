What you see in the example is how to use the `echo` command to display some text.

> ðŸ’¡ We'll explain how printing works in the next workout.

[1:Terminal]
Similarly to how you can use a mouse to tell the computer to open a file, you can also type in a command in the **terminal**.

The term "terminal" originates from the first computers, which had a physical terminal that was used to communicate.
