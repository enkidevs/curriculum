# Common Terminology


---

## Content

Let's go over a few terms that you'll see a lot in this course.

Linux comes with an improved version of the shell, which is called **bash**[1]. From now on, we'll be using these terms interchangeably.

> 💡 **bash** also refers to the programming language used to interpret the code within the shell.

Sometimes you might type some commands which are restricted. That's where the **root user** comes in. It's the unique admin user, with superpowers. Unsurprisingly, it's also called the **superuser**.

The **package manager** removes the tedious process of installing or uninstalling apps. Think of a **package** as being an app.

> 💡 As with all the skills in the app, if you want to access more advanced or specific content at any time, **feel free to use the *Skill Map* tab** to jump to the workouts most relevant for you.

## Footnotes

[1:Bash]
The name is an acronym for the "Bourne-Again SHell", a pun on the name of the Bourne shell (sh) it replaces (initially developed by Stephen Bourne).
