# What's Linux?


---

## Content

To understand what Linux is, let's go back to the very basics of computing.

A computer consists of physical parts, called *hardware*, and written programs, called *software*. 

Most computers have a special program that manages all other programs and helps them use the underlying hardware.

That program is called an **operating system**, or **OS** for short.

Although commercial computers that most of us use every day are mainly using Windows or MacOS, Linux is by far the most versatile OS.

> 💡Fun fact! The Linux OS is inspired by another older OS called Unix[1]. The name "Linux" is a combination of its creator's name, "Linus", and "Unix".

From cloud storage and space rockets, to your car or refrigerator, there's a high chance that they all run on Linux.
