# Why Use Linux?


---

## Content

There are many reasons to choose Linux over other operating systems. Let's start with the fact that **it's completely free to use**.

To be more specific, all of Linux is *open-source*[1]. 

As the code is publicly available, it's somewhat easy to extend a Linux distro and shape it however you want. Because of this, there are about 600 *flavors* of Linux available. We'll cover some of them later.

> 💡Fun fact: the most popular OS for mobile phones, Android, is a modified version of Linux  

Here are a few more reasons to use Linux:

- It *works with any hardware* (from low-end to high-end)
- It's *secure* (continuously reviewed by experts)
- It's *fully customizable* (you can change anything you want!)

For these reasons, Linux is the most popular platform used by developers (according to Stack Overflow; see the Learn More link).

This means that all of the code that makes Linux is available to *everyone* and it can be freely redistributed and modified.
