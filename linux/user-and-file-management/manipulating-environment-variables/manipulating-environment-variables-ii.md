### Modifying an Existing Variable

You'll often want to modify an existing variable by appending or prepending data. To do this, you can reference an environment variable inside a string:

```bash
export FOOD="waffles"
echo $FOOD
# waffles

export FOOD="chocolate $FOOD"
echo $FOOD
# chocolate waffles
```

### Unsetting an Environment Variable

To unset or clear an environment variable use `unset`:

```bash
export FOOD="waffles"
echo $FOOD
# waffles

unset FOOD
echo $FOOD
# 
```

> ðŸ’¡ If you reference a variable that hasn't been created yet (or that has been unset), it will have an empty string `""` as a default value.

## Practice

Modify, then unset, the variable.

```bash
echo $SOMETHING
# foobar
export SOMETHING="bar ???"
echo $SOMETHING
# bar foobar
??? SOMETHING
```

* $SOMETHING
* unset
* SOMETHING
* set

## Revision

Fill in the gaps to get the result:

```bash
a_var="bar"
a_var="???$???"
echo ???
# foobar
```

* foo
* a_var
* $a_var
