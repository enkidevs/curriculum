# Understanding `PATH`

---
## Content

Understanding the `PATH` environment variable and how to manipulate it is one of the most important things a beginner can master.  

The contents of `PATH` tell your shell where to look for executables.  It is therefore central to understanding what happens when you type a command in the terminal.

### What Does The `PATH` Variable Contain?

The `PATH` variable itself contains a `:`-delimited list of directories:

```bash
echo $PATH
# /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

> ðŸ’¡ The fact that `:`'s are used to delimit the directories here is a matter of *convention*.  Other parts of the system assume the list is `:`-delimited, but if in the 1970s we had settled on `,` or `;` instead, we would still be using that today.
