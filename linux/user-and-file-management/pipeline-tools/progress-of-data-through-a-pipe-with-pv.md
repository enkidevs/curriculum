# Monitor the progress of data through a pipe with 

`pv`


---

## Content

You can use `pv` to monitor the progress of any pipe.

This can be done by installing `pv` and putting it between input / output pipes.

To install:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install pv
```

Example:

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom | pv | dd of=/dev/null
```

Output

```bash
1,74MB 0:00:09 [ 198kB/s] [ <=> ]
```

You could specify the approximate size with the `--size` if you want a time estimation.

You can also use it to output to stdout:

```bash
$ pv /home/user/bigfile.iso | md5sum
```

Output

```bash
50,2MB 0:00:06 [8,66MB/s] 
[==>  ] 49% ETA 0:00:06
```

Note that in this case, `pv` recognises the size automatically.

Using `pv` can prove extremely useful when working with big files or processes taking long time to complete.
 For example you can keep track how fast a file is transferred with `nc` command:

```bash
$ pv myFile | nc -w 1 example.com 3000
```
