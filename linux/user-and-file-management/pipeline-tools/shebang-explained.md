## Content

The shebang (`#!`) at the head of a script tells your system that this file is a set of commands to be fed to the indicated command interpreter. 

In order for these to work, the script must have *execute* permissions.[1]

```python
#!/bin/sh
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/bin/tcl
#!/bin/sed -f
#!/bin/awk -f
```

Depending on the situation, we might need to run a script with a different version :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python 
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
Or :
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
```
To ensure the script is run using the first interpreter in `PATH` use `/usr/bin/env`:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

## Practice

What should be added to the script in order for the system to use the first `node` interpreter in `PATH` ?
```
#! ???
```
*`/usr/bin/env node`
*`/usr/bin/node`
*`/bin/sh`
*`/usr/bin/env node4`

---
## Revision

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
Is used to tell the system what ??? 

should be used for that particular file.
*interpreter
*script
*path
