# The `2>&1` redirection

---

## Content

You can use `2>&1` at the end of a command to incorporate the error stream into the output stream.
For context, `1` is `stdout` and `2` is `stderr`.

At first, `2>1` may look like a good way to redirect stderr to stdout. However, it will actually be interpreted as "redirect stderr to a file named 1".

`&` indicates that what follows is a file descriptor and not a filename.
So the construct becomes `2>&1`.

This can be useful when you want to pipe the output through a *filtering function*:

```bash
$ ls -ld ~ /tnt 2>&1 |
        sed '/[nN]o/d'
#this will print
drwxr-xr-x 18 osboxes osboxes 4096
        Jun  9 16:01 /home/osboxes
#instead of
ls: cannot access '/tnt': No such
         file or directory
drwxr-xr-x 18 osboxes osboxes 4096
         Jun  9 16:01 /home/osboxes
```

There's also the shorthand notation that combines the stream merging with the output redirection:

```bash
$ ./script.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
# same as
$ ./script.sh &> /dev/null
```

## Practice

Redirect stdout to stderr :

    $ ls -ld ~/ ???

* `1>&2`
* `1>2`
* `2>&1`
* `2>1`

## Revision

You can incorporate the error stream into the output stream using

??? .

* 2>&1
* 1>&2
* 2>&0

## Quiz

### how do you merge output streams?


Which of the following commands will suppress both stdout and stderr?

 ???

* ./script.sh &> /dev/null
* ./script.sh > /dev/null 1>&0
* ./script.sh 2>&1 > /dev/null
* ./script.sh 2>&0 > /dev/null
