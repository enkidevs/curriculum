## Content

Use `xargs` to build and execute commands
from standard input. This often provides a simpler construct than using explicit loops.

Consider:

```
$ echo 1 2 3 4 | xargs echo
// output 1 2 3 4
```
The `-n` flag specifies the **max** output per command line:
```
$ echo 1 2 3 4 | xargs -n 2
// output (2 per line):
// 1 2
// 3 4
```
Suppose you want to delete all files in `/path`.
```
$ rm `find /path -type f`
```
Running the command above may fail because there are too many files in `/path`, exceeding the command line maximum length.

Instead, running the following won't[1]:
```
find /path -type f -print | xargs rm
```
The difference is that `xargs` will print the input take from `find` in sublists and call `rm` on each one.

For commands that require more than one argument at the time, the `{}` default argument list maker can be used[2]:
```
$ find . -name "*.bak" -print0 |
 xargs -0 -I {} mv {} ~/old.files

```
Output from the `find` will substitute for every file found both `{}` occurrences.

## Revision

`xargs` takes the ??? stream and transforms it into the ??? stream for other utilities to use.
*STDIN
*STDOUT
*STDERR

## Footnotes

[1:error handling]
To make sure empty files are treated correctly, pass the `-0` flag to `xargs` to split the lists at **null** chars together with `-print0` flag of the `find` command.
[2:example explanation]
The command below will find all `.bak` files in the current directory then move them to `~/old.files`.
