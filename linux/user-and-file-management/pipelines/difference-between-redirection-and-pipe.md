# Difference between `redirection` and `pipe`

---
## Content

**Pipe** and **redirect** are two similar concepts, yet the distinction between them is made in the following way:

- `redirect` refers to passing the *output* to a **file** or a **stream**
- `pipe` refers to passing the *output* to another **program** or **utility**


Let `p1` be a program that when ran will give a certain output.

To put all the *output* inside a file (say `myFile`), **redirection** is necessary[1]:
```
$ p1 > myFile
```
However, to use the *output* as *input* of another program (say `p2`) things are different. An auxiliary file can be used (say `tmp_file`)[2]:
```
$ p1 > tmp_file && p2 < tmp_file
```
Because this approach is quite clunky, **pipes** have been invented to make things easier. You can achieve the exact same thing with the syntax:
```
$ p1 | p2
```

## Practice

Complete the following snippet to redirect or pipe `script.sh` :
```
$ script.sh ??? cat -n
$ script.sh ??? file.txt
```

* `|`
* `>`
* `>>`
* `&&`

## Revision

_Piping_ refers to passing the output to another program or utility, while _redirecting_ to

???.


* passing the output to a stream or file
* passing the output to a script
* passing the output to `cat`
* passing the output to an utility

## Quiz 
### which of the following is not a valid command?

Pick the option that would throw an error.

 ???

* cat enki.txt > grep "enki"
* cat enki.txt | grep "enki"
* ls -l > enki.txt && cat < enki.txt
* grep "enki" < enki.txt

## Footnotes
[1:explanation]
What happens when running the following line:
```bash
$ p1 > myFile
```
1. `p1` is executed
2. *output* of `p1` is put in a file called `myFile`.

If `myFile` already exists, it will be overriden.

[2:explanation]
What happens when running the line:
```
$ p1 > tmp_file && p2 < tmp_file
```

1. `p1` is executed
2.  *output* of `p1` is saved in the file called `tmp_file`
3.  `p2` is executed having as *input* the contents of `tmp_file`
