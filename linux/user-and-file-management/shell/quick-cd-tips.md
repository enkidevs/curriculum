# Quick `cd` Tips

---
## Content

The `pushd` command saves the current working directory in memory so it can be returned to at any time. You can think of it as an evolution of `cd`, because `pushd` stores the history of your visited folders.

To move to a new directory, you would use:

```bash
pushd projects/
~/projects ~
```

After calling `pushd`, the directory stack is logged in the shell.

If you want to add the current directory to the stack, you would call `pushd`:

```bash
~/projects/project_1 pushd
~ ~/projects/project_1
```

Note that in this case, you are returned to the first directory in your queue.

To check the directory stack, use `dirs`:

```bash
dirs
~ ~/projects/project_1
# add the -v flag
# to include indexes
# and increase readability
dirs -v
0 ~
1 ~/projects/project_1
```

Note: the first item in the stack will always be the current directory.

To navigate the stack, append `+n` to `pushd`, where `n` is the index of the stack item. Let's say we have the following stack:

```bash
dirs -v
0 ~
1 ~/projects/project_1
2 ~/projects/project_2
pushd +2
~projects/project_2
```

To remove items from the stack, you would use `popd`. If used with no arguments, it removes the first element in the stack (which is the current working directory of index 0), and switches the working directory to the next item (index 1). If used with the `+n` argument, it removes the `n`th element from the stack, but **doesn't** change the current working directory.

```bash
dirs -v
0 ~
1 ~/projects/project_1
2 ~/projects/project_2
~projects/project_2 popd
~/projects/project_1
~/projects/project_1 dirs -v
0 ~/projects/project_1
1 ~/projects/project_2
~/projects/project_1 popd +1
~/projects/project_1
```

To clear the stack, add the `-c` to `dirs`:

```bash
~/projects/project_1 dirs -c
```

Or, to undo the last change of directory and go back to last visited path:

```bash
cd -
```

## Practice

Directories saved by `pushd` can be seen using ???.

* dirs
* cd -
* topd
* dirs -c

---
## Revision

`pushd` ,`popd`  and `dirs` are shell built-ins which allow you to manipulate the ???.

* directory stack
* switch
* directory queue
* memory
