# Rapidly invoke an editor to write a long, complex, or tricky command


---

## Content

Next time you are using your shell and need to enter a long command,
try `ctrl-x e` (press `x` and `e` while holding control key).

The shell will take what you've written on the command line so far and paste it into the editor specified by `$EDITOR`. Then you can edit at leisure using all the powerful macros and commands of `vi`, `emacs`, `nano`, or your preferred editor.
