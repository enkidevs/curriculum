---

## Content

Use the `stat` command to get a file's permissions in octal form:

```bash
stat -c "%a %n" file
```

From the man page of `stat`:

```plain-text
-c  --format=FORMAT
%a     Access rights in octal
%n     File name
```

Examples for files:

```bash
stat -c "%a %n" .ssh/id_rsa 
600 .ssh/id_rsa
```

Folders:

```bash
stat -c "%a %n" /var/www
755 /var/www/
```
