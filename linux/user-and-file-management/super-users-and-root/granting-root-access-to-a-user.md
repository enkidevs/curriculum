## Content

To give a specific user `root` access, you need to add the user to the `root` permissions group.

If you want to create a new user:
```
$ adduser newUser
$ passwd newUser
```
To add newUser to the *root* group, run:
```
$ adduser newUser root
# or
$ usermod -aG root newUser
```

Or to give it root privileges manually:
```
$ visudo
# and add the following line under
newUser ALL=(ALL:ALL)  ALL

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL)  ALL
newUser ALL=(ALL:ALL)  ALL
```

Note that the user must log off and back on for this change to take effect.
