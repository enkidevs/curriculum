# Run previous command as root


---

## Content

Without including `sudo` before a command, sometimes a 'permission denied' message can be received.

`sudo !!` solves this problem.

Upon entering the following: 

```bash
$ rm -r private_file
```

You won't have the permission to execute this unless you're logged in with elevated privileges.

What `sudo !!` does is it runs the previous command as `root`. Meaning it now becomes :

```bash
$ sudo rm -r private_file
```

## Revision

A hack to re-run the last command as root is:

    $ adduser newUser
    $ ???

* `sudo !!`
* `!!`
* `sudo adduser newUser`
* `adduser newUser`
