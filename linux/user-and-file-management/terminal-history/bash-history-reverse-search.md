# Bash history reverse search


---

## Content

You can search your bash history using `Ctrl+R`. For example, filtering by *nano* yields:

```plain-text
(reverse-i-search)'nano':
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

It searches every part of the command (comments as well) and shows the most recent first.

To cycle through the alternatives, keep pressing `Ctrl+R`.

- Ctrl+R
