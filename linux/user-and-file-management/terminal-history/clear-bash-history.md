## Content

If not altered every command executed on a linux system is stored in the `.bash_history ` file.

That file is in the home directory of the user executing the command.
If we need to clear our current history we do:
```
$ cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history
$ history -c
```

To clear another user's file we do the same:
```
$ cat /dev/null >
/home/otherUser/.bash_history
```

Keep in mind that we have to be logged in as *root* to clear another user's `bash_history` file.
