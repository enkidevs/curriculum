# Execute a command without saving it in history


---

## Content

Adding one or more spaces before your command will result in `history` not recording it.

This is useful for passwords (those long mysql connections) on the command-line.

For example:

```bash
$ echo 1
1
$  echo 2
2
$ echo 3
3
$ history
  ...
  501  echo 1
  502  echo 3
  503  history
```

This might not work *by default* on some shell setups.

## Revision

Depending on your setup, adding ???

at the beginning of a command will make `history` not record it.

* space
* @
* !
* ?
