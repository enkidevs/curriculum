## Content

Tag commands for future reference:
```
$ some_command -some_flag
       some_path # useful
```

Then it is possible to search your bash history using `Ctrl+R`:

```tex
(reverse-i-search)`#useful': 
  some_command -some_flag some_path #useful 
```

Because `# useful` is just a comment in bash you are not limited to this word. Therefore, creative use of tags can save you time. 

Command history is saved in *~/.bash_history* file, which is emptied after a history limit is reached. In order to preserve the tag collection, a backup of the file is needed.
