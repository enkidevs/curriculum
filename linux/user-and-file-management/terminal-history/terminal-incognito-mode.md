# Terminal incognito mode


---

## Content

To temporarily disable command logging in the terminal, use:

```bash
set +o history 
```

Or, alternatively:

```bash
shopt -uo history 
```

To enable command logging once more, run:

```bash
set -o history 
```

Alternatively:

```bash
shopt -so history 
```

There are no noticeable differences between the two commands, both being used to modify the same optional shell behavior.
