# Clear the terminal instantly


---

## Content

We can clear the terminal instantly by pressing `ctrl + L` . This will achieve the same as issuing `clear` command.

To reinitialize the terminal and clear the previous outputs, it's possible to run: 

```plain-text
reset
```

This won't, however, reinstantiate the shell, meaning you will still be logged as sudo.
