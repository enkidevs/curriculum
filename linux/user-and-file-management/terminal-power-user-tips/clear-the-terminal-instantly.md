# Clear the terminal instantly

---
## Content

We can clear the terminal instantly by pressing `ctrl + L` . This will achieve the same as issuing `clear` command.

To reinitialize the terminal and clear the previous outputs, it's possible to run: 
```
$ reset
```
This won't, however, reinstantiate the shell, meaning you will still be logged as sudo.
