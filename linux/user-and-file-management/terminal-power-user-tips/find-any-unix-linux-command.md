## Content

It's possible to perform keyword searches under linux using the `apropos` command.

Each manual page has a short description available within it and `apropos` searches the descriptions for instances of the keyword.

How to search all the user related administrative commands:
```
$ apropos "user*"
```
Outputs:
```
addgroup - add a user/group to the system
adduser  - add a user/group to the system
...
```

install-docs (8) - manage online
