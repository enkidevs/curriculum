## Content

Sometimes when deleting a file, the error "File is already in use" is encountered, with further trouble locating the process using the file.

To find any processes using the file you can use `fuser` command : 

```
fuser -k filename
```

The command above will search for the file  and kill whatever processes are using it.

## Revision
