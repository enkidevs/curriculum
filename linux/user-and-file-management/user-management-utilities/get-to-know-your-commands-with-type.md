## Content

The `type` command is used to differentiate between *builtin* commands and *external binaries*.

Subsequently, you can find different *types* of commands[1].

Find an **alias**:

```bash
$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
```
Find a **file**:
```bash
$ type rm
rm is /bin/rm
```
Find a **builtin**:
```bash
$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```
Find a **function**:
```bash
$ type psgrep
psgrep is a function
psgrep () 
{ 
    ps -ef | { 
        read -r;
        echo "$REPLY";
        grep --color=auto "$@"
    }
}
```

You can also check the type of `type`:
```
$ type type
type is a shell builtin
```
