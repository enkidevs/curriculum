## Content

You can generate passwords in the terminal in many ways. Two of them are listed below.


Using `openssl`:

```console
$ openssl rand 32 -base64
WkY+q7Z5YmiHTrpV0lwtSApbepky1BNWc1s1E7lFcpY=
$
```

The `rand 32` option tells `openssl` to generate a random sequence of 32 bytes and `-base64` tells `openssl` to base64-encode the output (see the link at the end for details).

Using `pwgen`:

```console
$ pwgen -s 40
hAZmJQZkAf44F3Zoazl7II8bv07e5ta2COmFQdjK
$
```

By default `pwgen` generates pronounceable passwords.  The `-s` option tells `pwgen` to generate completely random, secure password instead (containing only letters and numbers).  `40` is the length of password to generate.


By using the `-y` option we can tell `pwgen` to also include symbols in the password:

```console
$ pwgen -s -y 40
i^^iAa5o^oc["+43[G]{62&S!&Mt:L]ny7qbR~g0
$
 
```

## Practice

Generate a random 20 chararacters password using `pwgen` :
```
$ ??? ??? ???
```
*`pwgen`
*`-s`
*`20`
*`openssl`
*`40`

## Revision

You can generate a 30 characters password with `openssl` by running:
```
$ ??? ??? -base64 30
```
*`openssl`
*`rand`
*`sudo`
*`genran`
