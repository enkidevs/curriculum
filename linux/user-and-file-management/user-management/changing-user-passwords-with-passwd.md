## Content

To change a user's password, including your own, use the `passwd` command.

To change your own password, simply run `passwd` without any additional arguments.  You will be asked to enter your current password and then type a new password twice to confirm it.  You do *not* need to have `root` permissions to change your own password, so it's not necessary to use `sudo`.

To change another user's password, supply a username to the `passwd` command.  You *do* need `root` permission to change another user's password, so it's necessary to use `sudo`, like so:

```console
$ sudo passwd jesse
```

This will prompt you to change the password for the user `jesse`.

There are many options available to `passwd`, like requiring a user to change it after a certain number of days, forcibly expiring a user's password, etc., but they are only used in more advanced contexts and can vary from system to system.

Read `man passwd` for more details.
