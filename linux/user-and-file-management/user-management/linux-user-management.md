# Other User Management Recipes

## Content

To list all existing users you can use:
```bash
$ cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```
To remove/delete a user:
```bash
$ userdel newuser
```
And to delete their home directory:
```bash
$ rm -r /home/newuser
```
Or just pass the `-r` flag with `userdel` to delete their account and their home directory:
```bash
$ userdel -r newuser
```
To change the password for a user:
```bash
$ passwd username
```
To change the shell for a user:
```bash
$ chsh username
```
To change the details for a user (real name, for example):
```bash
$ chfn username
```
