While the `chown` command allows us to change a file's ownership, the `chmod` command allows the permissions.

There are many ways to use the `chmod` command, so make sure to read `man chmod`.  Here are some of the most common.

### Adding or Removing Permissions

Start with these three examples:

```console
# Make ~/waffles.txt user writable
$ chmod u+w ~/waffles.txt

# Make ~/waffles.txt group writable
$ chmod g+w ~/waffles.txt

# Make ~/waffles.txt writable by everyone
$ chmod o+w ~/waffles.txt
```

Similarly, `u+r` would make the file user readable, `g+r` group readable, and `o+r` readable by everyone else.  `+x` is the same for the executable permission.

If instead we used `u-w` or `u-r`, we would *remove* the writable (or readable) permission for the current user.

Here we can better see how the changes are reflected in `ls` output:

```console
$ ls -l waffles.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 jesse admin
    0 Jun 13 08:45 waffles.txt
$ chmod g+w waffles.txt
$ ls -l waffles.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jesse admin
    0 Jun 13 08:45 waffles.txt
$ chmod o+w waffles.txt
$ ls -l waffles.txt
-rw-rw-rw- 1 jesse admin
    0 Jun 13 08:45 waffles.txt
$ chmod g-w waffles.txt
$ ls -l waffles.txt
-rw-r--rw- 1 jesse admin
    0 Jun 13 08:45 waffles.txt
$
```

As we add and remove permissions, you can see the changes reflected in the permission string displayed by `ls -l`.

## Practice

Give *full* access to `enki.txt` for the user and its group and remove access of others:
```
$ ??? ???,o??? ???
```
* `chmod`
* `ug+rwx`
* `-rwx`
* `enki.txt`
* `ugo`
* `+rwx`
