# File Ownership


---

## Content

On Linux, every file and directory is given both a user owner and a group owner.  You can use `ls -l` or `ls -ld` to see which user and group owns a specific file or directory (respectively).

Here is some example output:

```bash
$ ls -ld /var/log
drwxrwxr-x 10 root syslog
    4096 Jun 13 06:25 /var/log
$ ls -l /var/log/syslog
-rw-r
```


---

## Practice

Consider the following snippet:

```bash
$ ls -l schedule.txt
-r-xr-xr-- 10 student students
436 Jul 15 13:21 ~/schedule.txt
```

Who has the fewest permissions for this file?

???

* Others
* User
* Group
* They all have the same permissions


---

## Revision

You can use `???` to see which user or group owns a specific *file*.

* `ls -l`
* `ls -a`
* `ls -o`
* `ls -d`
