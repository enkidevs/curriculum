## Content

You can search your bash history using `Ctrl+R`. For example, filtering by *nano* yields:
```
(reverse-i-search)'nano':
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```
It searches every part of the command (comments as well) and shows the most recent first.

To cycle through the alternatives, keep pressing `Ctrl+R`.
