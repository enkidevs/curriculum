## Content

To temporarily disable command logging in the terminal, use:
```bash
$ set +o history 
```
Or, alternatively:
```bash
$ shopt -uo history 
```
To enable command logging once more, run:
```bash
$ set -o history 
```
Alternatively:
```bash
$ shopt -so history 
```
There are no noticeable differences between the two commands, both being used to modify the same optional shell behavior.
