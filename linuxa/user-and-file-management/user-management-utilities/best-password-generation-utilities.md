## Content

`apg`  displays six somewhat memorable passwords based on your keyboard input. Entirely random ones can be produced with ```apg -a 1```, which contain 8-10 totally randomised characters.

`pwgen` floods your terminal with a set of passwords so you can pick one.

Some additional flags :

`pwgen -1`: gives you a single password rather than an entire screen full of them;

`pwgen -s`: uses a different algorithm to make it more secure;

`pwgen -y`: adds special characters to the given password.

You can also use `makepasswd` : 

```
$ makepasswd -count X -minchars Y
```
Just replace `X` with the number of passwords required and `Y` with the minimum length of each in the code above.

Another use could be : 
```
$ makepasswd -string 1234567890 -chars 4
``` 
That would create numerical-only, four digit long passwords (think PIN codes).
