# if Statements

---
## Content

In Lua, the `if` statement is used for **conditional execution of code**. It allows you to **test a condition** and **execute code if the condition is true**.

The basic syntax for an `if` statement is as follows:
```lua
if condition then
   -- code to execute if condition is true
end
```
On your own, try using the `if` statement in conjunction with an arithmetic operator! Refer to the footnote if you'd like to see an example[1].

--- 

## Practice

Create an `if` statement using `y == true` as the condition:
```lua
if ??? then
   -- code to execute
end
```

- `y == true`
- `[y = true]`
- `y is true`
- `y = true`

## Revision

Create an `if` statement using `x ~= 7` as the condition:
```lua
if ??? then
   -- code to execute
end
```

- x ~= 7
- x = 7
- x not 7
- [x ~= 7]

## Footnotes

[1: If Statement Example]
```lua
if x ~= 5 then
   -- code executes when variable `x` does not equal 5
end
```
