# if Statements

---
## Content

In Lua, the `if` statement is used for conditional execution of code. It allows you to **test a condition** and **execute code if the condition is true**, otherwise, execute another block of code.

The basic syntax for an `if` statement is as follows:
```lua
if condition then
   -- code to execute if condition is true
end
```
On your own, try using the `if` statement in conjunction with an arithmetic operator! Refer to the footnote if you'd like to see an example[1].

--- 

## Practice

Create an `if` statement using `y == true` as the condition:
```lua
if ??? then
   -- code to execute
end
```

- y == true
- [y = true]
- y is true
- y = true

## Revision

Create an `if` statement using `x != 7` as the condition:
```lua
if ??? then
   -- code to execute
end
```

- x != 7
- x = 7
- x not 7
- [x != 7]

[1: If Statement Example]
```lua
if x != 5 then
   -- code executs when variable `x` does not equal 5
end
```
