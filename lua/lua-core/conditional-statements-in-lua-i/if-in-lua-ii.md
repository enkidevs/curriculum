# if Statement Example

---
## Content

Here's another example of an `if` statement in Lua. This **checks if a number is positive and prints a message accordingly**:
```lua
num = 10
if num > 0 then
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

In this example, since the value of `num` is 10 and greater than 0, the message **"The number is positive" will be printed**.

## Practice

Finish the code to output "The number is positive" if the condition is met.
```lua
num = 10
??? num > 0 ???
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

- `if`
- `then`
- `while`
- `do`

What will happen when we execute the following piece of code?
```lua
num = 10
if num > 0 then
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

It will ???.

- Output "The number is positive"
- Error due to bad syntax
