# if Statement Example

---
## Content

Here's an example of an `if` statement in Lua that checks if a number is positive and prints a message accordingly:
```lua
num = 10
if num > 0 then
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

In this example, if the value of `num` is greater than 0, the message "The number is positive" will be printed.

---
## Practice

Finish the code to output "The number is positive" if the condition is met.
```lua
num = 10
??? num > 0 ???
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

- `if`
- `then`
- `while`
- `do`

```lua
num = 10
if num > 0 then
  print("The number is positive")
end
```

It will ???.
