# What are Conditional Statements?

---
## Content

Similarly to other programming languages, Lua allows the use of **conditional statements**. These **allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions. **

For instance, a program can *check for the boolean value of a variable* and can *perform one set of actions if its true*, and a *different set of actions if its false.*

The most common types of conditional statements in Lua are the `if` statement, the `if...else` statement, and the `if...elseif...else` statement.

> If you're still confused, don't fret! Each conditional statement will be explained further and help your understanding of conditionals!
