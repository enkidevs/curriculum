# Installing the Interpreter II

---

## Content

After you've installed the Lua interpreter, you should test that the interpreter works. 

You can test it by **running the** `lua` **command in your terminal or command prompt**. If Lua is installed correctly, you should see the **Lua prompt (>) appear**. 

You can then enter Lua code and see it executed.

> To open a command prompt, press the Windows search option (or the Launchpad Icon for Mac) and search for terminal.
