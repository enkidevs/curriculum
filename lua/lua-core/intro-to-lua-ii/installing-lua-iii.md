# Installing Text Editors

---
## Content

As for text editors, there are many options to choose from, including **Sublime Text**, **Atom**, **Notepad++**, **VSCode** and more. 

> Check out each editor before choosing the one that you're most comfortable with! We recommend VSCode due to its customizability.

On a side note, if you do not want to install the interpreter, you can use their website IDE[1] to test some code or view their demo programs: [live demo](https://www.lua.org/demo.html).
