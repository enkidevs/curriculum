## Content

> This insight is completely optional for those that plan to code Lua on a different platform from Roblox Studio.

As for text editors, there are many options to choose from, including **Sublime Text**, **Notepad++**, **VSCode** and more. Check out each editor before choosing the one that you're most comfortable with! 

Remember, using a website IDE[1] to test some code is perfectly acceptable for this course: [live demo](https://www.lua.org/demo.html).
