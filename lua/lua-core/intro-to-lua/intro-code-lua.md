# Hello World

---
## Content

Like with every other language, let's write our first hello world program!

When you run this code, you should find the words, "Hello world!" in the terminal[1].

```lua
print("Hello, world!")
-- Hello, world!
```

In the coding segment:

- The `--` is used to denote a **single line comment**. These often contain notes written by the author!
- The `print("Hello, world!")` is used to **output the string**[2] "Hello, world!" to the terminal.

## Practice

Finish the code below to print out "Hello world!" to the terminal.

```lua
???("Hello, world!")
-- Hello, world!
```

- print
- Print
- terminal
- Terminal
