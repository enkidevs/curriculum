# Addition and Subtraction

## Content

**Arithmetic operators** are used to **perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers**.

The arithmetic operators for Addition and Subtraction in Lua are:

|      Name      | Sign |
|:--------------:|:----:|
|    Addition    |  (+) |
|   Subtraction  |  (-) |


Here are some examples:
```lua
-- Addition
result = 2 + 3  -- result = 5

-- Subtraction
result = 10 - 5  -- result = 5
```
