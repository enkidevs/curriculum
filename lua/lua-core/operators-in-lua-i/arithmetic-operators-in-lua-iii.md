# Modulo and Exponentiation

---
## Content

The arithmetic operators for Modulo[1] and Exponentiation in Lua are:

|      Name      | Sign |
|:--------------:|:----:|
|     Modulo     |  (%) |
| Exponentiation |  (^) |

Here are some examples:
```lua
-- Modulo
result = 10 % 3  -- result = 1

-- Exponentiation
result = 2^3  -- result = 8
```

> It's important to note that arithmetic operators in Lua follow the standard order of operations[2]. To change the order of operations, you can use parentheses.

## Practice

What is the value of the variable `result` in the code below?

```lua
result = 2^3 
```

???

- 8
- 16
- 4
- 6

## Revision

What is the value of the variable `result` in the code below?

```lua
result = 21 % 4
```

???

- 1
- 84
- 0
- 5

## Footnotes

[1: Modulo]

The Modulo Operation returns the remainder of a division.

[2: Standard Order of Operation]

The standard order of operations is referred to as PEMDAS or BODMAS.

PEMDAS stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.

BOMDAS stands for brackets, orders, division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction.
