# Logical Operators

---

## Content

Logical operators are used to **perform logical operations** on all values. 

There are three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

Unlike most coding languages, **not all logical operators will return a boolean value** in Lua, as both `and` and `or` will return one of its operands[1].

> For these operators, `false` and `nil` as operands are considered false and all other operands are true.
