# Logical Operators

---

## Content

Logical operators are used to **perform logical operations on boolean** values. 

> Recall that boolean values are either `true` or `false`.

These operators will **output true or false** based on the *given operator and operands*[1]. For instance, if there are two conditions, one operator will output `true` if both conditions are `true`. 

The three logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.
