# What are Operators?

---
## Content

In Lua, operators are used to perform **arithmetic**, **logical**, and **relational** operations on values. 

They can be used with **various data types** such as *numbers, strings, booleans, and tables*, and can be combined to form more complex expressions. 

Lua also provides **bit-wise operators** and **concatenation operators** for strings.
