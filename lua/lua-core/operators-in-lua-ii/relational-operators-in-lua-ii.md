# Greater and Less Operators

---
## Content

These are the **greater** and **less** Operators:

|           Name           | Sign |
|:------------------------:|:----:|
|         less than        |   <  |
|       greater than       |   >  |

They compare whether **one value is greater than or less** than the other value.

Here's an example:
```lua
a = 10
b = 5

print(a > b)  -- true 
print(a < b)  -- false
```
---
## Practice

Add the appropriate relational operator to each equation to match the output comment:
```lua
a = 5
b = 10
c = 10

print(a ??? b)  -- true 
print(c ??? a) -- true
print(b ??? a) -- false
```
