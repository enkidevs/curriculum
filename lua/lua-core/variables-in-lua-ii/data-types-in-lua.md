# Data Types

---

## Content

**Lua supports various data types** to represent different kinds of information. Understanding these data types is fundamental to effective programming, as while Lua is fairly dynamic and data types can be used interchangably, **knowing the data types** of variables is **essential before running specific operations**.

For instance, *you can't do math operations with strings*, since they're words, not numbers.

The most used data types include:
- Strings
- Integers and Floats
- Booleans
- Nil
- Tables

- Setting data types require a plugin for them to properly work
