## Content

Coefficient of determination (R^2 for short) is a statistical technique in which we will use to measure our **regression model performance**.

It usually ranges from 0 (bad or constant) to 1 (awesome), but we may find negative results as well (which are even worse).

For an example, if we built a regression model to predict the stock market, this technique would tell us how well our model is performing.
