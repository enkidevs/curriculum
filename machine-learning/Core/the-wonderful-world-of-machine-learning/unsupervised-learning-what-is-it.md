`Unsupervised learning` is a conjunction of techniques to help finding inferences or structures in the dataset. Unlike `supervised` learning, it does not make predictions about future data points and it is often **used to preprocess the inputs** for `supervised learning models`.

The main technique of `unsupervised learning` is `clustering`. It is used to find patterns and grouping in the data when doing a **exploratory analysis**.

To illustrate the behavior of a clustering algorithm, suppose we..
(WIP - make a cool svg with coloured scatter plot to demonstrate K-Means clustering, there's no other cool way to demonstrate it)

(Also, make an example of outlier detection in the clustering to symbolicate what is an outlier).
