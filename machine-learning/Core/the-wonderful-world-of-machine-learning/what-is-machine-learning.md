Machine learning "_gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed_" - Arthur Samuel, 1959. The concept is old - as almost all concepts in computer science - but yet, is changing the way we interact with software.

The definition of machine learning is a **field of computer science that automates the analytic model building**, using algorithms that learn from past experiences. This allow programs to find hidden insights **without being explicitly programmed where to look**.

It borrows knowledge from `statistics`, `math` and `programming` areas to solve complex problems that a normal program would not be able to.

In the following insights, we will be learning about the three major machine learning study areas: `Supervised learning`, `Unsupervised learning` and `Reinforcement learning`.
