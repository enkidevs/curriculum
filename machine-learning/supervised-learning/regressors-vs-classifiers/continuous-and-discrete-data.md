**Continuous** data represent a value that can be **measured** in a scale, such as *prices, weight, height and speed*. Those values allow non-integer values, such as **70.21 km/h**.

However, **discrete** or **categorical** variables can only be **counted**, as they represent a set of values with **no sense of proximity**, such as *occupations, people and binary values*.

But why is this important for machine learning? Let's suppose we are trying to predict a person's **occupation** (which is a discrete variable), if the real occupation was *civil engineer* but we predicted *software developer*, are we **close** or **far**? We just can't tell, we just got the **wrong** prediction.

If we were trying to predict a person's height (continuous variable), in which the the real height was **187.2 cm** but we predicted **188.0 cm**. That's a very close shot, right? This **matters a lot** on how we **measure our model efficiency**.
