# Why MongoDB?


---

## Content

MongoDB is a free, open-source, document-based database that stores documents in BSON (Binary JSON) format, grouped in *collections*.

Those documents are schema-less and can have any number of fields, varying over time. For instance, in any valid MongoDB collection, we can have one document with 1 field, another document with 40 fields, and another document with 12 fields.

Notable properties:

* Support for indexes on any field or sub-field of a document
* Three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods
* Drivers in numerous programming languages such as `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Perl`, `Python`, `Ruby`, and more.
* Support for *ad hoc* queries such as field, range, and regular expression searches.
* High availability using replica sets with two or more copies of the data where each replica set may act as the primary replica at any time.
* Support for multi-document `ACID` transactions

## Practice

Documents in a MongoDB collection always have to have the same structure.
