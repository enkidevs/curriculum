      2: Use the insertMany() method to add multiple new documents within an existing or new collection
      3: Use the find() method to find a specific document located within a collection
      4: Use the find() and limit method to list an exact number of documents within a collection
      5: Use the update() method to modify or replace a single or multiple documents within a collection
      6: Use the updateOne() method to modify a single document within a collection
      7: Use the updateMany() method to modify multiple documents within a collection
      8: Use the replaceOne() method to replace a single document within a collection
      9: Use the deleteOne() method to delete a single document within a collection
      10: Use the deleteMany() method to delete a single, multiple or all documents within a collection
      11: Use the remove() method to remove a single, multiple or all documents within a collection
      12: Use the createCollection() method to create a new collection within the current database
      13: Use the show collection command to display all available collections within the current database
      14: Use the drop() method to delete a collection within the current database
      15: Use the find() and sort method to sort documents within a collection in a specified way
      16: Use the save() method to either replace an existing document or add a new document to a collection
      17: Use the renameCollection() method to rename a collection
      18: Use the findOneAndUpdate() method to find the first document matching the specified criteria and update its content
      19: Use the findOneAndReplace() method to find the first document matching the specified criteria and replace it with a newly specified one
      20: Use the findOneAndModify()method to find the first document matching the specified criteria and modify it
      21: Use projection to include or exclude fields from the output of the query
      22: Use the Remove() method to delete the first document matching the specified criteria
      23: Use the findOneAndDelete() method to delete the first document matching the specified criteria
  aggregation-pipeline:
    name: Use a variety of aggregation operations to process data and return the result in a single document
    description: Use aggregation operations to process data in variety of ways to return a specific result
    objectives:
      0: Use the aggregate() method to look through multiple documents and return a computed result
      1: Use the $limit aggregation stage to limit the amount of documents to return
      2: Use the $count aggregation stage to count the number of documents within a collection
      3: Use the $sort aggregation stage to sort documents in a specific order
      4: Use the $skip aggregation stage to skip a specific number of documents starting from the first one
      5: Use the $match aggregation stage to match documents in a specified way
      6: Use the $group aggregation stage to group documents together
      7: Use the $project aggregation stage to include or exclude documents from the aggregation pipeline
      8: Use accumulators related to the $group stage to group documents and perform different calculations
      9: Use the $sortByCount aggregation stage to group and sort documents by a specified expression
  update-operators:
    name: Use field update operators to update documents in various ways
    description: This standard deals with learning to use various update operators to update documents
    objectives:
        0: Use the $set operator to set a new value for a specified field
        1: Use the $inc operator to either increment or decrement the value of a specified field
  comparison-operators:
    name: Use different comparison operators to perform better queries
    description: This standard deals with learning how to use various comparison operators to more efficiently perform queries
    objectives:
        0: Use $gt to match values that are greater than the specified value.
        1: Use $gte to match values that are greater than or equal to the specified value.
