# Habit Building

---
## Content

The key factor of learning is **to not cram everything into one session**.

This is important because our brains were not designed to remember large portions of data at once.

Taking a big task and spliting it into smaller, less challenging **bite-sized tasks** is one of the best ways to build a habit.

As *James Clear* demostrated in his *Power of Tiny Gains* graph:

Doing one percent better every day, vs doing one percent worse every day amounts to alot in the long run.

```plain-text
Doing 1% better every day:

1.01^365 = 37.78

Doing everything the same:

1^365 = 1

Doing 1% worse every day:

0.99^365 = 0.03
```

These numbers significantly add up in just one year.

Let's say you want to learn how to play the accoustic guitar.

You cannot try to recreate any song the same day you start playing. First, you have to learn the basics.

- How do you hold a guitar? 
- Which note does each string represent?
- How does each note sound?
- How to produce chords?
- and so on.

For the first day, set aside five minutes to learn how to hold a guitar. The next day, add one more minute, and if you've learned how to hold the guitar, switch to the second task.

Practice that task every day, but increase the time you practice by one minute every day.

When you reach a day where you've set aside 60 minutes. To make it easier, split those 60 minutes into two-30-minute sessions.

The adding of one minute a day, doesn't need to be related to time. 

You can keep the 60 minutes or less per session but add one more song to play every day. The point is to keep increasing your routine by a small amount to build a good habbit.

> If a task you've chosen feels hard, do not avoid it by going down the path of least resistance![1] Repeat it until you're satisfied with your result.

## Footnotes

[1: Path Of Least Resistance]

The path of least resistance is the tendency for all forms of life to follow the easiest route.

Let's say you're thirsty. 

All you have at your home is tap water, which you know is not that good.

Would you rather dress up, go to the store to buy bottled water? 

Or would you drink the tap water and think: "It is not that bad if I drink it once"?

We tend to do this for everything. How many times have you taken a shortcut because it was easier?

Naturaly, we all experience these tendencies. The trick is to not follow them when building a new habit!
