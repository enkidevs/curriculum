# Multitasking is Bad

### What is Multitasking?

Multitasking is the process of doing more than one thing simultaneously.

For a long time, we used to think that people who are good at multitasking have had an advantage compared to people who weren't. We were wrong.

We cannot naturally focus on two tasks at the exact same time. However, we can switch focus between tasks super fast that it feels like it is happening simultaniously.

### Are all Forms of Multitasking Bad?

Multitasking small and meaningless is not detrimental.

Like reading a book and drinking something.

When it comes to complex tasks, although you feel like you're accomplishing more when doing two or more tasks at once, switching between them actually decreases your productivity and effectivness.

Try solving a differential equation on paper while riding a bicylce. 

It would be impossible to constantly drive and write at the same time. You will have to focus on one task more than the other.

Focusing on driving will help you not fall. Whereas if you focus on solving the equation, it may impare your driving.

Multitasking can also increase stress and reduce memory forming.

Brains were designed to do one task at a time. Try recalling two memories at once? It is impossible. You cannot think of what you did at the age of 6 and 31 at the same time, you have to do it separately.

Try it yourself. 

Take two books from separate subject. Read one page on each. Keep switching the book after every page.

When you reach the end, test how much you've remembered.

Most of the time, your brain will connect stuff from one books pages to the other one and vice versa.

Then the next day, take another set of different books. However, this time, read only one book. When done with this book, read the second one and test yourself again.

This time you will retain much more and more accurately remember what was writen in which book.
