# Teach Others

---
## Content

One of the best ways to practice what you learned, is to try to teach it to other people!

Because people think differently, teaching others inspires you to think of different examples, which in return, ends up strenghtening your knowledge.

This doesn't only help with memory.

Since you have to remember what you've learned to be able to teach it, remembering it multiple times also strenghtens your understanding on the topic.

Teaching, or preparing to teach information actually helps us retain and understand that information better. This is called the **protégé** effect.

The more you try to teach others the more your communication and leadership skills will increase!

### Why Does The Protégé Effect Work?

> People will try to remember more when they need to transfer that information onto others.

This can happen for numerous reasons. You may want to impress them, help them, have anxiety of not knowing the topic well enough, and so on. 

Whatever the reason for you, it will help you retain more information.

You don't have to teach what you learned to experience the protégé effect. You can also pretend while learning that you will teach to achieve the same effect.

Research has found that just pretending to teach will help you retain more information!
