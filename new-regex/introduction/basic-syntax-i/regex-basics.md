# Regex basics

## Content

Very basic regex patterns can be *identical to the content* of the string we want to test:

```
string = 'Fred'

/fred/ ❌ 

/Fred/ ✅
```

However, most of the time we want to make our patterns a bit more flexible...

Say we want to find all names beginning with `'Fre'` from the following list.

'Fred, Freya, Francis'

We could use `/Fre/` as our regex pattern to match the following:

'**Fre**d, **Fre**ya, Francis'

This would not match the whole name, just the letters '**Fre**'. 

In order to match the whole name, we'd have to use quantifiers and wildcards - more about those next!

## Practice

How could we match items in a shopping list that include the word 'apple'?

???

* `/apple/`
* `/a/`
* `/🍏/`
* `/Apple/`

## Revision

When writing regex patterns, capitalization matters.

???

* True
* False
