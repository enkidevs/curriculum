## Content

The `Navigator` panel is one of the most important panels on Webflow.

You can open the panel by pressing the second tab on the left side, or by pressing the `Z` key. 

This panel can be used to visually see the hierarchy of your elements.

You can change the position of the elements on the Canvas from within the `Navigator` panel.

You can find the position of an element on the Canvas by clicking on it in the `Navigator` panel and vice versa.
