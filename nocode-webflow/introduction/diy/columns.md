# Columns

---
## Content

Columns are layout elements used for organizing content horizontally.

Each column is self-contained, meaning that they can have different styles, sizes, and contain different elements.

By default, when you create a new column element, it is divided into two. Also, the total size of all columns in a row must add up to 12. This number represents 100% of the element width. So, if you have two columns, setting them both on size 6 would make them occupy 50% of the screen each. 

Here is how a default column element looks like:

To edit the number of columns and their sizes, click on the column element and select the "gear" symbol.

**Note:** Each column element consists of a single row of columns.

You can edit the sizes of the columns by moving the numbers on the bottom of the `Columns Settings` panel. There are different default size values depending on the number of columns you select, but all are customizable.

Creating a column is the same as adding a new element. There are three ways:
1. Click anywhere on the canvas and left-click a column element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.
2. Drag and drop a column element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.
3. Drag and drop a column element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.

Here is an example of a column elements elements that contains one list and three images:
