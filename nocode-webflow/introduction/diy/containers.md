# Containers


---

## Content

As we have previously discussed, a container is also represented by another box element. The only difference is that containers **can't** be nested within another container.

Containers are used to group a bunch of elements together for easier positioning, styling, text editing and more.

By default, all elements in a container are centered relative to the window they're being viewed on.

For instance, let's say we have four text elements and an image element all positioned one under the other.

Example without a container:

![default-no-container](https://img.enkipro.com/73fe01c37bb4e50c24a3516dd84447ec.png)

The image above is how four default paragraphs and a default empty image would look like upon creation. 

Now, if we add them to a container:

![added-in-container](https://img.enkipro.com/7b5bfecd9ea7ec3641a19fd89681251b.png)

We can now apply a layout to all five elements by editing their top-level container element.

After applying positioning to the container without editing any of the elements inside we get:

Other than positioning, containers can be used to apply styling, group elements and much more.

Creating a container is done the same as creating a section element. There are three ways:

1. Click anywhere on the canvas and left-click a container element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.
2. Drag and drop a container element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.
3. Drag and drop a container element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.
