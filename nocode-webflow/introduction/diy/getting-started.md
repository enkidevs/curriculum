# Getting Started

## Content

Now that we know how to start from a Template, a lot of the times, we will want to start from scratch.

To create a new project from scratch, go to `Dashboard -> + New Project -> Blank Site`.

A new popup window will ask you to name your project. After giving it a name, press create and you're done.

As you can see in the `Navigator` in the image above, a new project doesn't have a single element in it.

We can test at any time how our project looks by publishing a prototype version of it on Webflow for free.
