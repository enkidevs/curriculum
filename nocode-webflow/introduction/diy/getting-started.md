# Getting Started

## Content

To create a new project from scratch, go to your [dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard), click on the `New Project` button and select `Blank Site`.

A new popup window will ask you to name your project. After giving it a name, press create and you're done.

As you can see in the `Navigator` in the image above, a new project doesn't have a single element in it.

We can test at any time how our project looks by publishing a prototype version of it on Webflow for free.
