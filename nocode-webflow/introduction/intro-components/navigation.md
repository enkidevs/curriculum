# Navigation


---

## Content

All websites have some form of navigation to make it easier for users to find their way through the webpage.

For this purpose, Webflow provides a powerful component called `Navbar`.

By default, `Navbar` comes with the following elements:

- logo (an image element)
- navigation links
- invisible button
  - used when the screen is too small to show the `Navbar`, just like on mobile

Here is an example of an empty `Navbar`:

And here is an example of a `Navbar` with an `<Enki/>` logo and one more link section:

Because the `Navbar` is a component, you add it as you would add an ordinary element[1].

To add a new link element, select the `Navbar` and add a new link in the `Navbar Settings` panel on the right side of the screen.

Above the `Add link` button there is a `Link Settings` section. The five buttons are used to determine what kind of link you want. After choosing an option, the bottom part of the `Link Settings` will change. 

For instance, choosing the first `URL` button will give a placeholder for a custom link with a checkbox button to "Open in new tab".

## Footnotes

[1:Adding elements]
If you forgot how to add elements, here is a reminder:

- Click anywhere on the Canvas and left-click a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel to add it to the previously clicked position.
- Drag and drop a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel anywhere on the canvas.
- Drag and drop a `Navbar` element from the `Add Elements` panel to a position in the `Navigator`.
