# Sliders

## Content

Sliders can be used to create any number of things, like a slideshow of some pictures or a product. 

On Webflow, when you create a Slider, it comes pre-designed with some elements:

![navigator-def-slide](https://img.enkipro.com/f4c1dbcc07680b70f242b6ca964d9d04.png)

As you can see, the slider has two navigation buttons (highlighted in purple), a `Slider nav` element with a link per page of the slider, and a `Mask` element that contains all the slides.

Because `Slider`s are components, you can add them as you would an element[1].

To add a new slide element, select the `Slider` and add a new slide in the `Slider Settings` panel on the right side of the screen.

The `Slider settings` panel can also be used to add animations, an attribute or to select a specific slide.

A good example of a `Slider` is how Netflix presents its categories.

As you can see, Netflix has sliders for each category separated into several movies per slide. The number of movies per slide depends on the screen size.
