# Symbols


---

## Content

Symbols are instances of an element that can be reused at any time. Symbols are usually made for recurring elements like a `Navbar` or `Footer` elements.

The reason Symbols are used for recurring elements is because when you edit the symbol on one page, all instances of that symbol are updated across any number of pages.

There are several ways you can create a Symbol.

By selecting the element you want and going to the `Add` panel and selecting the `Symbol` section and pressing "Create New Symbol".

Another way of creating a Symbol is by right-clicking an element and selecting the "Create New Symbol" option.

Or by pressing the appropriate shortcut.

All three options will give you a popup window to name your Symbol.

After creating a Symbol it will be located in the `Symbol` section of the `Add` panel.

Here is an example of how changing one symbol propagates to other identical symbols:
