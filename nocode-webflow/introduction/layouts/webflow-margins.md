# Margins

---
## Content

As you might've already noticed, margins are also parts of the spacing group. With margins, you are creating space between the block and everything surrounding it. Basically, you use margins to separate your block from everything outside it.

After position the contents of the box, you can apply margins so that the elements outside are at the desired distance.

To apply margins, open the style editor (using the `S` key), and find the spacing group. Along with padding, you can also see the margin option. As before, you can edit the value by either clicking on them or by clicking and dragging.
