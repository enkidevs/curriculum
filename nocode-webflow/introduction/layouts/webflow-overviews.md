# Grid View


---

## Content

The last display option that was not mentioned until now is grid. This option is similar to flexbox, in that the children elements are arranged horizontally and vertically.

In this case, the arrangement is done in a grid (as you might've already guessed). You can customize how many elements there are per row, how their sizes are distributed, and you can even customize the distances between rows and columns.

When deciding what to use between flexbox or grid, think about it like this:

- flexbox allows control of one dimension (either horizontal **or** vertical)
- grid allows control of both dimensions (horizontal **and** vertical)

## Practice

Complete the following:

Flexbox allows control of ???.

Gridbox allows control of ???.

- one dimension
- both dimension
- the horizontal axis only
- one diagonal
