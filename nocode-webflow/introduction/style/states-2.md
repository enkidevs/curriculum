# States Example


---

## Content

Let's say we have this simple form:

![simple-form](https://img.enkipro.com/be9a3458b5cf07aeff2f3a282cb5e54d.png)

After selecting the button, we can select the `Hover` state and add a shadow to appear when it is hovered.

To add this effect, go to the `Style` panel, select the `Hover` state, and scroll down to the bottom. Under `Effects`, select `Box shadows` and move the slider or write 4 in the `Distance` bar.

**Note:** You can edit the styling of all states on a single element. 

To view the styling, first switch back to `None` (because the `Canvas` always displays what is selected). If the state we added an effect to is selected, the effect will be displayed on the Canvas.

After selecting `None`, just hover over the button to view the effect.

Let's say that you also wanted to change the color of the button when it is pressed. Select the `Pressed` state, go to the `Background` bar and select the color green.

Now our button will change its color when it is pressed.
