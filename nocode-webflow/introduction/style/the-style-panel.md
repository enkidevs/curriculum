# The Style Panel


---

## Content

The style panel can be used to edit an element's layout, spacing, positioning, color, effects and more. It is located on the right side of the `Designer`. 

An important feature of the style panel is that it can be used to create new classes, edit already existing classes, or change the class of an element at any time.

Depending on where your website is viewed (tablet, phone, computer, etc.), you can edit each view independently using the style panel.

To use the style panel, select an existing element and you are good to go. The style panel is always active and responds to your selections.

You are not limited to applying effects to one element at a time. Using classes (concept that will be explained in the following insights), you can apply changes to all the elements that belong to a class by only editing one element of that class.

Here are some of the options that you will find in the style panel:
