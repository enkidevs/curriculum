# Filter Templates


---

## Content

The [templates page](https://webflow.com/templates) gives users the ability to filter through the templates.

There is a search bar you can use to easily find the templates you want.

Under the search bar, there are 4 categories as well as a tags bar that you can use to filter through the templates.

The search bar is highlighted in red, the categories are highlighted in green and the tags are highlighted in blue.

The 4 categories are `Free`, `Premium`, `CMS` and `Ecommerce`. 

There are over 50 different tags like `Blog`, `Recipe`, `Wedding`, `Winery`, `Movie`, `School`, `CV`, `One page` and many more.

These categories and tags provide a good filtering option when you want to find the desired template.

For instance, you can choose the category `Free` and select the `One Page` tag to only show templates that have one page and that are free.

## Practice

Finding a new template on Webflow is ???

- easy because the website offers a search bar, 4 main categories and over 50 tags to customize your search.
- hard because you only have a search bar.
