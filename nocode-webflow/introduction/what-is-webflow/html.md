# Hypertext Markup Language


---

## Content

`HTML`, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is an essential building block of every web page.

**HTML's primary purpose is to list the content used in the web page.** `HTML` will display text, labels, lists, insert photos/media, create hyperlinks, buttons, and containers. This is all done with `HTML` elements. 

Additionally, each `HTML` element can be used to separate content into sections. You can also nest `HTML` elements within each other for better control over the page layouts and content.

However, `HTML` is **NOT good** for creating animations, managing responsive layouts, and other similar interactions within the content.

In short, `HTML` is used to create the structure of the website, but it can't be used to create the styling. 

With Webflow, you don't need to write the code to create different elements. You can create them through the `Designer`. Any time you add a new element, the code will be auto-generated.
