# Webflow Setup

---
## Content

Webflow is a web app, so all you need is an online account!

Webflow has a free to use version called "Starter Plan", where you can use a variety of their tools without paying for anything. However, a lot of more powerful tools are only available in the premium version.

The free version can help you review and test the program for as long as you want without spending any money. You can even make a responsive website for free and host a prototype version on their domain. However, you can't make it live or download the code without paying.

To make an account, you can either click on any of these buttons or go to their [sign up page](https://webflow.com/dashboard/signup):

The sign up page looks like this:

Next, you'll see a couple of questions to tailor the experience for your needs and expertise.

After completing the on-screen steps, depending on what you chose, you will get a screen like this:

And you're ready to get started!
