# The Element Panel


---

## Content

Adding elements to your project is done through the `Add Element` panel. It is located on the left side of the `Designer` page and divided into several categories. Another way of opening this panel is by pressing the `A` key.

There are 3 ways to add an element to your project. 

1. You can select the place you want to add your element by clicking on it, then open the `Add Element Panel` and click on the element you want.
2. You can open the `Add Element Panel` and drag and drop the desired element to the desired location on the canvas.
3. You can open the `Add Element Panel` and drag and drop the desired element on the desired location in the navigator.

The third option is the most precise because you don't have to aim the element's box to make sure you add it to the correct place. You can just drop it in the appropriate location within the navigator.
