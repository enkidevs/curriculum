# The Box Model


---

## Content

The box model is used to describe the layout of elements in the webpage.

Essentially, all elements you create are treated as boxes and each box can be nested or grouped. 

For instance, you can create a box for an image and a box for a caption for that image. Then you can take both of those boxes and add them in a `container`. 

Let's say we have two boxes: `image` and `text`.

We can put these two boxes (elements) inside a `container`. If we want to move or edit either of the boxes, we can do it through the `container`.

If you move the `container`, all boxes nested inside it will also be moved.

You can use the container to edit the positioning, animation, styling and more of **all** the other **nested** elements.

The box model has a responsive design. This means that the box size and position depends on the resolution it is being viewed on. 

Since everything on Webflow is customizable, you can set your boxes to have the following sizes:

- fixed
- relative
- auto-adjustable based on resolution
