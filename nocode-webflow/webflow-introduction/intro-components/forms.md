# Forms


---

## Content

Components are elements with pre-designed functions.

Forms are used to represent a section of a document that contains interactive controls for a user to input information such as input text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

To create a simple form go to the `Add Element` panel and under forms select `Form Block`. Because forms are elements, they follow the same rules when being added to your webpage.

Here is how a forms looks like in the `Canvas`:

And here is how it looks like in the `Navigator`:

All forms on Webflow are fully customizable, meaning that after creating a `Form Block` you can remove or add elements to it. 

**Note:** You cannot add a form element anywhere outside of a form, but you can add a non-form element, like a photo, to a form. 

If we tried to add a form element, in this case, a label, outside of the form, we would get this error:

If we wanted to add or remove an element, we can do it both from the `Canvas` and the `Navigator`.

If we wanted to edit the settings of a form element, we would need to either double click the element on the `Canvas` or select it either in the `Navigator` and edit the settings on the right side panel.

Double-clicking will give you the green highlighted settings. To view, all settings select the second panel on the right side.
