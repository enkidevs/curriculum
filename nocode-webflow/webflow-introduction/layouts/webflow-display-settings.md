# Display Settings


---

## Content

In design, there are multiple ways you can get your component to display, and the elements surrounding it have different behaviors depending on the option.

To change the display setting, open the style panel and find the `Layout` group.

Hovering over each option will reveal its name and a short description.

### Block

- usually the default settings
- starts on a new line **and** pushes other elements down on another new line
- takes up full width (unless explicitly set)

### Inline-block

- block elements that can be stacked side by side
- allows specific width, height, padding, and margin to be applied

### Inline

- default style for text inside elements
- you can change margins and paddings
- you **can't** change width or height

### None

- hides the element completely
- elements won't be rendered by the browser

## Practice

Match the word with its description.

```plain-text
block  ???
inline ???
```

- starts on a new line and pushes other elements on new lines
- allows stacking on the same line but can't change width and height
