# Paddings


---

## Content

When styling your components or elements, you might have to change the padding. 

To have a better understanding of what padding is, think of a component as a square box. If you want to squeeze the contents of your components further away from the border (the border is represented by the side of the square) you would apply padding to it.

To change the padding of an element, go into the style tab and find the `Spacing` group.

Now, you can change the padding for each side by either clicking on the number, or by clicking and dragging.
