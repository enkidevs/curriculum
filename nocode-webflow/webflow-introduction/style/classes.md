# Classes


---

## Content

Classes are used when we want to apply the same styles to different elements without having to style every element from scratch[1].

Classes save all styling information applied. While editing a class, any element with the same class name will also be edited.

To create a class or select an existing one, first create any element or select an existing one. 

Next, under the `Style` panel there is a `Selector` field.

![selector-field](https://img.enkipro.com/051f003c4183ec7e43c2887d0f60f9e6.png)

Click the selector field and you will get a dropdown menu:

Now you can either select one of the existing classes or create a new one.

To create a class just type the name and press enter:

![example-class](https://img.enkipro.com/3f0b9211d7531a36948b9b66ac7fe431.png)

After hitting enter your input will turn blue, letting you know a new class was created.

Now, anything we apply to that class through the `Style` panel is saved and can be reused at any time and on any element within your webpage.

To edit a class name, duplicate or delete it, select the class you want to edit and open the dropdown menu.

**Note:** If only one element has a particular class and you accidentally removed the class from the element, you don't have to worry. Just start typing the name of the class and the class will be shown in the "Existing classes" section.

## Footnotes

[1:Example]
For instance, imagine your web page has over 300 paragraphs. Between the 300 paragraphs, you want to have 3 different stylings per 100 paragraphs. Imagine having to edit every single paragraph to get the desired effect. That would be very time consuming and that's where classes come in.

You can create a class and edit that class, then just apply it to any paragraph you want and that paragraph will have the styling of that class. This way, if you have 100 paragraphs, you only need to edit one of them and apply the class to the rest and save hours of tedious work.
