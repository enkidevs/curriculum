# States


---

## Content

States are used to change how different elements react in different instances. For example, you can set an element to popup on a `hover` state or a button to do something on a `pressed` state.

An element can have a total of four states:

- `None`
  - the default state of all elements
- `Hover`
  - display styling when the user hovers over an element
- `Pressed`
  - display styling when the element is pressed
- `Focused`
  - display styling while the element is in focus

States are located on the `Style` panel, and to see them you first need to assign a class to an element.

Example without a class:

![no-class](https://img.enkipro.com/71d95d052041b5e52c3e227bef9c2d62.png)

Example with a class:

![with-class](https://img.enkipro.com/24a7efbfadb4d12c00fcd82ef3a77f28.png)

Only when an element has a class can you open the dropdown menu and choose a state.

When you select a state, it will be highlighted in green:

![selected-state](https://img.enkipro.com/2ad527abba7858f68ae30005fb282179.png)

Before applying any effects, always check if that is the correct element and state you want to apply the effect to.
