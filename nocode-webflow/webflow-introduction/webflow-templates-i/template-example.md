# Using Templates


---

## Content

To create a project from a template, go to your [dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard) and create a new project.

To select a template, hover over the desired option and press select:

![example-select](https://img.enkipro.com/878ed20aae56aec5ef56740971baf7c3.png)

For instance, we are going to choose the `Portfolio Starter` template.

After you decide on a template and click `Select`, a new popup window will appear asking you to pick a name for your project.

We are going to type "Example Project".

After deciding on a name, press `Create project`.

Now that we have a new project from a template, we can customize it as much as we want and when we are done we can choose to publish it.

To publish a project while it's open, go to the top right corner of the current working project and click the `Publish Project` button.

This will give you 2 options:

- publish on their domain.
- publish on your own custom domain.

![publishing-options](https://img.enkipro.com/06eff9969f7b05c6bf01bf1f31e26e11.png)

For this example, we are going to choose the first option.

After selecting the domain and pressing `Publish to Selected Domain` the website will be ready.

As you can see in the image above, the yellow highlighted square is the link to the created webpage.

Underneath the option we selected, we can see the time it took to publish the webpage and we can also decide to unpublish the webpage anytime we want to.
