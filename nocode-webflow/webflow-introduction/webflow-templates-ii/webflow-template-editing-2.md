# Editing Templates


---

## Content

To edit an imported template, start off by going to [your dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard). If you haven't made any changes yet, it should look something like this:

![image-of-project-card](https://img.enkipro.com/242d884cbd2d9efe1261b4c10186a964.png)

There are two types of editing you can do:

- in the designer
  - here you can edit the content as well as the structure and design
- in the editor
  - here you can only edit the content

To access the designer, you can click on the project that you want to edit.

If you want to access the editor, you must first ensure that your project is published. Afterwards, from the dashboard, click on the `...` found in the bottom right corner of your project card. From there, select `'Editor'`.
