# The Designer


---

## Content

One of the most powerful Webflow features is the `Designer`.

This interactive website building software is completely customizable and it's where you'll spend most of your time.

The `Designer` consists of 5 main elements:

- the *left toolbar and panels* (used for structuring your website, navigation, adding new elements and much more)
- the *Canvas* (which provides real-time webpage interaction where you can see the end result as well as modify any element by dragging and dropping, resizing and more)
- the *top bar* (page number, save, undo, publish, export code and few more features)
- the *bottom navigation breadcrumb bar* (mostly for navigation with a visible and clickable hierarchy of elements)
- the *right panels* (which give powerful control for each of your elements)

To access the `Designer`, you must first have a project (website). To create one, go to your [dashboard](https://webflow.com/dashboard) and click on the `New project` button.

Now, open the `Designer` by clicking on the project[1].
