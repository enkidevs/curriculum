# What's Webflow?


---

## Content

Webflow is a very powerful and unique **responsive website design tool**. You won't need to know how to write code (or how websites are made) to create a fully functional website.

In Webflow, you use something called the `Designer` in which you drag & drop components to create and customize your website. You don't need to see any code.

Although you don't need to code, you can always export the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of your website. Anything you create visually with their online tool will automatically create the code for you.

Furthermore, there are lots of pre-made layouts and templates you can use, free and premium, both of which are 100% customizable and can be tailored to your needs.

This way of creating websites significantly reduces the time for the `idea → design → production` process.

On top of creating websites, Webflow provides hosting and shop services (like payments).
