# Comparison Operators

---

## Content

Comparison operators can be used to compare various types of data, including numbers, strings, and booleans:


| Operator |             Name            |
|:--------:|:---------------------------:|
| ==       | is equal to                 |
| !=       | is not equal to             |
| <        | is less than                |
| <=       | is less than or equal to    |
| >        | is greater than             |
| >=       | is greater than or equal to |

```php
if ($num < 5) { // true
  echo "$num is less than 5";
}
// 1 is less than 5

if ($num != 2) { // true
  echo "$num doesn't equal 2";
}
// 1 doesn't equal 2
```

## Practice

Finish the code to output "$num is greater than or equal to 3" if the condition evaluates to

```php
??? = 5;
if ($num ??? 3) {
  echo "$??? is greater than or equal to 3";
}
```

- $num
- `>=`
- num
- 5
