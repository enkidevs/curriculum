# Nested if else Statements

---

## Content

In PHP, we can have an `if-else` statement inside another `if-else` statement. This is called nesting.

Nested `if-else` statements can be used to perform complex decision making.

Here's a basic example:
```php
$age = 20;

if($age >= 18){
  if($age <= 60){
    echo "You are an adult.";
  }
  else{
    echo "You are a senior.";
  }
}
else{
  echo "You are not an adult.";
}

// Output: "You are an adult."
```

## Practice

What is the output of the following code?

```php
$age = 70;

if($age >= 18){
  if($age <= 60){
    echo "You are an adult.";
  }
  else{
    echo "You are a senior.";
  }
}
else{
  echo "You are not an adult.";
}
// Output: ???
```

- You are a senior.
- You are not an adult.
- You are an adult.

## Revision

What is the output of the following code?

```php
$age = 15;

    echo "You are a senior.";
