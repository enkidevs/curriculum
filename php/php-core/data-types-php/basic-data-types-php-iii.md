## Content

The `string` type represents a sequence of characters, such as "hello", "Enki", and so on.

```php
$greeting = "Hello, world!";
echo $greeting;
// Hello, world!
```

Complete the following code snippet by declaring a `string` variable named `name` and assigning it a value of `"Enki"`.

```php
??? = "???";
```

- `$name`
- `Enki`
