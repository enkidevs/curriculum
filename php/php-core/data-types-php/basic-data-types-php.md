# Basic Data Types in PHP

---

## Content

In PHP, variable are loosely typed, meaning that they are converted automatically as needed by the context where they are being used.

**PHP** supports eight primitive types which can be grouped into three categories:

### Scalar types


- `int` for storing integers, like `5`, `-10`.
- `float` (or double) for storing floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or -0.001.
- `string` for storing sequences of characters, like "Hello, world!" or "Enki".
- `bool` for true or false.

### Compound types

- `array` for storing multiple values in a single variable.
- `object` for storing instances of classes.

### Special types


- resource for storing references to functions and resources external to PHP.
- NULL for a variable with no value.
