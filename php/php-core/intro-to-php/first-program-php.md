# Let's Create Our First Program!

## Content

Ready for some code?

It's time to create our first program!

`"Hello, World!"` is a simple program that prints the text `"Hello, World!"` to the screen. It is often used as a starting point when learning a new programming language.

In **PHP**, you can print text to the screen using the `echo` method. Here is an example:
```html
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>

// Hello, World!
```

Once you have PHP installed[1], you can save your program to a script file with the `.php` extension, for instance `hello.php` and run it using this command:
```bash
php hello.php
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.

## Footnotes

[1: Installing PHP]
To install **PHP**, you can follow these steps:

### Windows 

Download the VC15 x64 Non Thread Safe version from the official [PHP website](https://windows.php.net/download/). Then, extract the zip file to a directory.

### Linux 

**PHP** can be installed via the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you would use this command:
```bash 
sudo apt install php.
```

### MacOs

On macOS, **PHP** is preinstalled, but you can use Homebrew to install a more recent version.

```bash
brew install php
``` 

Once the installation is complete, you can start using **PHP** by writing scripts and running them with the **PHP** command-line interface or with a web server that supports **PHP** (like Apache or Nginx).
