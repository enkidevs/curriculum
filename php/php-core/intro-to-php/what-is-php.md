# What is PHP?

---

## Content

**PHP** is a general-purpose scripting language used by over 75% of websites.[1]

**PHP** code is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the client's browser.[2]

A unique feature of **PHP** is that it can be embedded directly within HTML:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello, world!";
?>

</body>
</html>
```

> Do not worry if you do not understand the code, this is just an example to get you confortable with the syntax. We will dive deeper into it later on.
