# Logical Operators

---

## Content

Logical operators in PHP are used to perform logical operations on the operands.

They mainly involve boolean values and they return a boolean value as a result.

The logical operators provided by PHP include:

| Operator | Name |
|:--------:|:----:|
|    `and`   |  AND |
|    `or`    |  OR  |
|    `xor`   |  XOR |
|     `!`    |  NOT |
|    `&&`    |  AND |
|    `⎮⎮`    |  OR  |
