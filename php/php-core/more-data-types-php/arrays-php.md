# Arrays

---

## Content

An array is a special variable that can hold multiple values at a time.

Here's how you define an array that holds 5 integers in PHP:
```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```

To access an element in the array, use the index of that element (keep in mind that indexing starts at 0):

```php
echo $numbers[0];  
// Output: 1
```

---

## Practice

Fill in the code to create an array of integers called `nums` that hold numbers from 1 through 5:

```php
??? = ???(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
```


- $nums
- array
- $arr
- nums

## Revision

Fill in the code to output the number 7 from the `numbers` array using its index:
```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
echo $numbers[???];  
// Output: 7
```
