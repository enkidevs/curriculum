# Creating and Storing Variables

---

## Content

Variables are crucial in programming. They are named locations in memory that store a value, which can be later retrieved and used. They allow us to store and manipulate data in a program.

In **PHP**, variables are declared with a dollar sign `$` and do not require a type to be specified:
```php
$x = 5;
$y = 10.0;
```

To print the value of a variable we use `echo`:
```php
echo $x;
// Outputs: 5
echo $y;
// Outputs: 10.0
```
