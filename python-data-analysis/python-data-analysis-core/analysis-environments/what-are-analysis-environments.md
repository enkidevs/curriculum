# What Are Analysis Environments?

---
## Content

When it comes to coding in Python, there are several environments you can choose from.

These environments are shells[1], [IDE's](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/ide), and other programs that let you write, test, and run Python code.

The most basic environment you can write Python in is your OS's terminal[2]. 

To try it out, open your terminal, type in the word `python` and press Enter.

A python environment that understands Python called is usually called *the [interpreter](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/interpreter)*.

> 💡 Different versions of Python will have different keywords to launch the interpreter. The most common ones are `py` and `python`.

Even though most operating systems come with a pre-installed version of the Python interpreter it is not the recommended tool for coding as it lacks many user-friendly features.

There are superior programs with better interpreters, such as:
- Jupyter Lab
- IDLE
- nteract
- PyScripter
- Google colab
- VScode
- and many more

> 💡 Some of the awesome features these provide are type suggestions, syntax highlighting, in-line graphics, and so on.

In this course, we will be using the Jupyter Lab environment.

[1: Shell]

Shells are command-line tools used to execute code.

[2: Terminal Gif]

Terminals are programs on the computer that let us communicate with shells. We send input (commands) into and receive output (results) out of the shell via a terminal.

Here's how we can run the `python` shell:
