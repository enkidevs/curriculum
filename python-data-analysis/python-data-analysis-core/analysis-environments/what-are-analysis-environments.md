# What Are Analysis Environments?

---
## Content

When it comes to coding in Python, there are several environments you can choose from.

Analysis environments are shells, [IDE's](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/ide), and other ways where you can test, run, modify, execute, and so on..., a programming language's code.

For instance, the most basic environment you can write Python is in your OS's terminal[1]. 

You can write and test code here by first initializing the [interpreter](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/interpreter) by typing `python` in your terminal.

> 💡 Different versions of Python will have different keywords to launch the basic interpreter. However, the most common ones are `py` and `python`.

Even though most operating systems come with a pre-installed version of the Python interpreter it is not the recommended way for coding. This is because there are far superior environments with better interpreters for coding in Python.

Some of these are:
- Jupyter Lab
- IDLE
- nteract
- PyScripter
- Google colab
- VScode
- and many more

> 💡 Some of the more superior features are type suggestions, syntax highlighting, in-line graphics, and so on."

In this course, we will be using the Jupyter Lab environment.
