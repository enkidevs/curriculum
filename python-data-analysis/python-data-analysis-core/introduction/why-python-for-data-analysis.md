# Why Python for Data Analysis

---
## Content

Most people choose Python when working with data. Whether it's for analysis, visualization, or manipulation of data, Python is very flexible.

There are several good reasons for this.

Python closely resembles the English language, which makes it quick to get started with, especially for beginners.

It has a mature ecosystem of tools for extracting and manipulating data.

These tools usually come from an ever-expanding collection of libraries, many of which are community-driven.

New libraries or updates to existing libraries arrive often. 

These libraries are the main reasons Python is great for Data Analysis.

Many of these libraries are created for specific tasks like analysis, visualization, array manipulation, and more.
