# Program to calculate +, - , * or /

---

## Content

How would you write a program that will add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers? The output should contain a message along with the result.

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating two variables that store any numbers. 

Then, use one of the available arithmetic operators to calculate those two numbers.

Finally, print the message along with the result.
