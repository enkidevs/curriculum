# Calculator

## Content

Can you create a `Calculator` class that has the ability to multiply, divide, subtract and add two numbers?

After creating the class, call each of the four methods with numbers to confirm it works.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- class creation (`class Something:`)
- initial class method (`__init__ (self...)`)
- function definition (`def something(x):`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating the `Calculator` class.

Then define the initial method with `self` and two variables.

Inside the method, access each variable using `self`.

Next, create four different methods `subtract`, `multiply`, `add`, and `divide`.

Each of them should take two variables as input and return the calculation described in the name.

Finally, outside of the class call each method.
