# Combine Dictionaries

---

## Content

Can you create a function that will take two dictionaries as input, combine them, and return a single dictionary?

> Don't forget to call the function afterward.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 33`).
- function declaration (`def...:`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining your function. It should take two dictionaries as input.

Inside the function, you can add one dictionary to the other one using `.update()`

Return the updated dictionary.

Then outside the function create two dictionaries.

Call your function with the two dictionaries inside a `print` statement.
