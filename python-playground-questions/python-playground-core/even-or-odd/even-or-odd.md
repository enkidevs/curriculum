# Even or Odd

---

## Content

Your friend Mark recently bought a box of glass spheres. Can you write a program that will determine if he has an even or odd number of spheres? Print a message along with the result when you're done.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, %, ...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating a variable that stores the number of spheres. 

Then, use a flow control statement along with the appropriate arithmetic operator to check if it is even or odd.

Finally, print the message along with the result.
