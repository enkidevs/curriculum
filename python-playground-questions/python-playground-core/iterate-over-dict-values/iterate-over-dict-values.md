# Iterate over Dictionary Values

---

## Content

Given a dictionary:

```python
myDict = {
  'name': 'Stefan', 
  'surname': 'Stojanovic', 
  'age': 27, 
  'country': 'Serbia'
}
```

Can you write a program that iterates over each element and prints them out?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation `person ={'name':'Stefan','age'...}`
- loops (`for...in`)
- built-in methods(`.items()`, `get()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating the dictionary.

Next, initiate a `for` loop that will go through each key-value pair of the `dict`.

Example:
```python
for x, y in dictionary.items():
```

Lastly, inside the loop, print each pair.
