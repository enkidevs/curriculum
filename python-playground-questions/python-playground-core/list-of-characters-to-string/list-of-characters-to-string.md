# List of Character to a String

---

## Content

Given a list of characters:
```python
c = [
  'h', 
  'e', 
  'l', 
  'l', 
  'o', 
  ' ', 
  'w', 
  'o', 
  'r', 
  'l', 
  'd'
]
```

Can you write a program that will take a list as input, transform the list into a string, and output the result?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)
- loops (`for...in...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating the list of characters.

Next, define your function.

Inside the function create an empty string and initiate a `for...in` loop to go through every character of the list.

Then, inside that loop, assign each character to the empty string.

At the end of the function, return the string inside a `print` statement.

Finally, call the function with the list.
