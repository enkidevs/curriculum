# Miles to Kilometers Converter

---

## Content

How would you write a program that will convert miles to kilometres? The output should contain a message along with the result.

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`)
- A kilometre is equal to `0.621371` miles
- A mile is equal to `1.60934` kilometres

As bonus points, you can also write a program to convert kilometres to miles.

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating two variables. One will hold the number of miles while the other holds the conversion factor.

Then, create a third variable that will hold the result of the conversion.

Finally, print the message along with the result.

Example input / output:
```python
# Input
3 miles

# Output

3 miles are equal to 4.8280 kilometres
```
