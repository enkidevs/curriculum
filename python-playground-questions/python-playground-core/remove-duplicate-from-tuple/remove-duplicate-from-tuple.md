# Remove Duplicate Values From a Tuple

---

## Content

Given a tuple with repeating words, can you define a function that will take a tuple as input, remove the duplicates, and output the result?

Tuple:
```python
myTuple = ("Stefan", "Mark", "Joane","Steven", "Natasha", "Mark", "Steven", "Mark", "Natasha")
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function definition (`def ...:`)
- loops (`for...in...:`)
- flow control (`if(x > 1)`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def duplicateRemoval(t):
```

Inside the function first, convert the input tuple into a list. (`list(variable)`)

Then initiate a `for...in` loop to cycle through every word.

Inside the loop, add an `if` to check the count of every word (you can use the built-in `.count()`).

If the count is greater than or equal to `2`, use the `.remove()` method to remove the duplicate.

Finally, convert the `list` back to a `tuple` using `tuple(variable)` and return the result.

Outside of the function, call the function with the provided `myTuple`.
