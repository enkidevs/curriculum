# Reverse String Characters

---

## Content

Can you write a program that will take a string as input and output it in reverse?

Example:
```python
# Input
Stefan Stojanovic

# Output
civonajotS nafetS
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating a string to reverse and an empty variable.

Next, initiate a `for...in` loop to go through each character.

Inside it, set the empty variable to equal the character plus itself.

Finally print the reversed string.
