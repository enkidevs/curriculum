## Content

Can you make a program that will take a sentence as input and output the total number of letters? The program should ignore spaces.

```python
# Input
Stefan Stojanovic

# Output
16
```

To achieve this, you can use some of the following concepts:
- loops (`for x in y...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

First, create a variable that will hold your sentence.

Next, create a value that will store the count.

Then initiate a `for...in` loop.

Inside it, add an `if` to check if the value is not space.

If it is not, increase the counter by 1.

Finally, print the result.
