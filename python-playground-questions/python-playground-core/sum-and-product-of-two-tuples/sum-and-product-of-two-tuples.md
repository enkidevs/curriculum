# Sum and Product of two Tuples

---

## Content

Can you define a function that will take two tuples as input, sum up the values in each tuple, multiply and print the resulting numbers?


Tuples:
```python
firstTuple = (1, 3, 5)

secondTuple = (2, 4, 6)
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function definition (`def ...:`)
- variable creation (`age = 30`)
- built-in methods (`sum(x)`, `list(x)`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def tupleAddition(a, b):
```

Inside the function convert each input tuple into a list. (`list(variable)`)

Then sum up all the values in each list.

Next, return the product of the summed up values.

Outside of the function, create the previously given tuples.

Finally, call the function with the two tuples.
