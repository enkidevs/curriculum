# Sum Dictionary Items

---

## Content

Can you write a program that will take a dictionary with at least five values as input, sum all of the values, and output the result?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 31`)
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating a dictionary whose values are numbers.

Then define a function that takes a `dict` as input.

Inside the function return the sum of the dictionary values.

Finally, call the function with the previously created dictionary.
