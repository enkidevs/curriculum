# Sort Lists in a Dictionary

---

## Content

Given a `dictionary` with three `list`s:

```python
dictList = {
  'first': [7, 1, 5, 3],
  'second': [4, 8, 2, 6],
  'third': [8, 1, 19, 13]
}
```

Can you sort the values in each list alphabetically?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- built-in (`sort()`)
- flow control (`for x in...:`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

> ðŸ’¡ The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating the `dict`.

Then initiate a `for...in` loop to go through the dictionary.

Next, inside the loop, sort the current values of the dictionary lists:

`dict[x].sort()`

Finally, outside of the loop, add a print to output the sorted result.
