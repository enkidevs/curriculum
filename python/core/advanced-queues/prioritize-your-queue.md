# Prioritize your `queue`

---
## Content

To use `PriorityQueue` data type we need to import it from `Queue` module.

It uses the sort method `sort` in order to decide what to retrieve from it first (your object must have a way of comparing its instances):
```python
import queue

class Enki(object):
    def __init__(self, priority):
       self.priority = priority
       return
    def __lt__(self, other):
       return self.priority < other.priority

q = queue.PriorityQueue()
q.put(Enki(55))
q.put(Enki(3))
q.put(Enki(100))
while not q.empty():
    print(q.get().priority)
# output is 3 / 55 / 100
```
Having defined the `__lt__` method[1], our `PriorityQueue` knows now how to sort elements of type `Enki`.

If we want to reverse the sorting order (greatest priority first), we would have to replace the `<` operator inside the `__lt__` function:
```python
class Enki(object):
    def __init__(self, priority):
       self.priority = priority
       return
    def __lt__(self, other):
       return self.priority > other.priority

 q = queue.PriorityQueue()
 q.put(Enki(55))
 q.put(Enki(3))
 q.put(Enki(100))
 while not q.empty():
     print(q.get().priority)
 # output is 100 / 55 / 3
```


To give an example of when it is advised to use `PriorityQueue`, we can think of a hospital. Here sick people come with no interruption. Now, in an ideal situation, the hospital's staff would prioritize people depending on how severe their illness is. If there is someone who suffers a headache should be treated only after one whose heart has stopped working was treated. In such a case we would use a `PriorityQueue` treating instantly all severe illnesses and put the others in the queue.

## Practice

Fill the following code snippet such that it will sort elements added in the queue in descending order:

```python

class Order(object):
  def __init__(self, ???):
    self.priority = priority
  def ???(self, other):
    return self.priority ??? other.priority

temp = queue.???

temp.put(Order(1))
temp.put(Order(10))
temp.put(Order(1000))

# Order of elements in the queue
# 1000 / 10 / 1
```

* priority
* `__lt__`
* `>`
* PriorityQueue()
* `<`
* queue
* `__order__`

## Revision

Which of the following instantiates a new priority queue:

```python
# Queue 1
q = new queue.PriorityQueue()

# Queue 2
new Queue q = queue.PriorityQueue()

# Queue 3
q = queue.PriorityQueue()
```

???


* Queue 3
* Queue 2
* Queue 1

## Footnotes
[1: Less than]
The `__lt__` (less than) method is used to override the functionality of the `<` (less than) operator when comparing `Enki` objects. As it is the case in most languages, `a < b` is the shorthand notation of calling `a.__lt__(b)`.
