# `weakref` callbacks

---
## Content

The `ref` constructor for weak references can take another argument, a callback function that is invoked every time the object referenced gets deleted:
```python
import weakref

class Enki(object): pass #empty object

def callback(reference):
    print("callback", reference)

enki = Enki() #definition of callback
r = weakref.ref(enki, callback)

del enki # callback is invoked
```

The output is:
```python
callback <weakref at 0x01554E40; dead>
```

These callbacks can be useful for example to remove dead references from a cache.

---
## Practice

Complete the following code snippet (supposing a callback function is defined):

```
 r = weakref.???(enki, ???)
```


* `ref`
* `callback`
* `call`
* `run`
* `flag`
* `bool`



* `flag`
* `boolean`
* `return`

---
## Revision

What functionality does `callback` carry in `r = weakref.ref(enki, callback)`?

???


* `callback` function is invoked when `enki` is deleted.
* In this case `callback` is a proxy to `enki`.
