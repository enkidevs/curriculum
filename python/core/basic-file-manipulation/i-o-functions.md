# I/O Functions

---
## Content

`I/O` (input/output) stands for the communication between a **data processing system** such as a computer, or any device, and the **outside world**.

Python provides numerous out-of-the-box functions for `I/O` communication, making the interactions fairly easy.

The most **basic output** function in **Python** is `print()`[1]. The arguments passed to it will be converted to **strings** and they will be outputted to the `stdout`[2].

The syntax simply is:

```py
print('This is a print statement.')
```

This will produce the following result on your screen:

```plain-text
This is a print statement.
```

For managing user input, **Python 3** provides a built-in function called `input()`. When using this **function** the program is **paused** and **waits** until the user finishes his input. You can also pass an **optional** string parameter to this function which will prompt the user with the given message.

Consider the following scenario:
```python
# user input will be assigned to `str`
str = input('Please enter your input: ')
# program will wait here for user input

# print the user input
print("The input is: ", str)

# print the type of `str`
print(type(str))
```

The `stdout` will look like:

```plain-text
Please enter your input: Hello
The input is: Hello
<class 'str'>
```

> The **input** of the user will **always** be returned as a `string` without any additional changes. 

If this **raw input** has to be transformed into another **data type** needed by the **program**, a `casting` function can be used. 

In the following example, we will use a **casting function** to find out the age of the user by converting the inputted string to an `int`:

```python
age = int(input('How old are you? '))
print(age, type(age))
```

The `stdout` will look like this:

```plain-text
How old are you? 21
21 <class 'int'>
```

## Practice

What will be the type of the `age` variable?

```py
age = input('How old are you? ')
print(age, type(age))
```

```plain-text
How old are you? 23
23 ???
```

* <class `str`>
* <class 'int'>
* <class 'list'>
* <class 'tuple'>

## Revision

Suppose we want to add `10` to somebody's age. Fill the gaps accordingly:

```py
your_age = ???(input('How old are you?'))
???(your_age + 10)
```


* `int`
* `print`
* `int()`
* `print()`
* `eval`
* `cast`
* `in`
* `eval()`
* `cast()`
* `in()`
* `string()`

## Footnotes
[1: print]
In Python 2 we had the `print` statement, later in Python 3 that statement was replaced by the function `print()`
```py
# Python 2
print 'Hello'
# Python 3
print('Hello')
```

[2: stdout]
Standard streams are preconnected communication channels between a computer program and its environment when it begins execution. There are 3 main connections standard input (`stdin`), standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`).
