# Class Keywords


---
## Content

There are a number of essential keywords associated with Python classes.

*Encapsulation* is where similar functions and variables are all grouped together.

Classes, variables, lists and more are all *objects*.

Classes are known as *data structures* as they hold both data and the methods needed to process the data.

Variables inside of classes are known as *attributes* of the class.

Functions inside any object type are known as *methods* (the case for class functions as well).
```python
# a data structure
class Employee:
    # an attribute
    count = 5
    # a method
    def print_idnum(self):
      ...
```
