# Arithmetic Operators

---
## Content

Similar to other programming languages, Python allows the use of standard arithmetic operators with numbers.

The four standard operators are for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` respectively.

Here they are in use:

```python
>>> 210 + 32
242

>>> 6-43
-37

>>> 9 * 8.12
73.08

>>> 62 / 9
6.888888888888889

```
In Python 3, division using `/` will return a float. If you are looking for the floor division, the `//` operator should be used:
```
>>> 62 // 9
6
```

## Practice

Choose the correct result of the following expression:

```python
>>> 1 + 2 * 3 - 6 / 2
```

* 4
* 5
* 7
* 6
