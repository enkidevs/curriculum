# Execution Order of Arithmetic Operators

---
## Content

When creating commands using arithmetic operators in Python it's very important you understand the order in which your command will be executed. 

What number do you think the following command will return? 

```python
>>> 2 + 9 * 4 / 3
```
The order of operation is multiplication, division, addition and subtraction respectively. Therefore making the output of the code: `14.0`. 

The above and below snippets are equivalent, with the snippet below using brackets to make the order of execution clearer.

```python
>>> 2 + ((9 * 4) / 3)
```
