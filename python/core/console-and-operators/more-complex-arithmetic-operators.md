## Content

Python also supports the `**` arithmetic operator, which multiplies a number to the power of another.

Here's this operator in use:
```python
>>> 2 ** 4
16
```
This code executes as 2 to the power of 4.

It also supports the modulo operator, `%`, which is used to return the integer remainder of a division sum.

Here's this operator in use:
```python
>>> 14 % 3
2
```
14 divided by 3 equals 4 remainder 2, the modulo operator returns the remainder, therefore 2 is returned.
