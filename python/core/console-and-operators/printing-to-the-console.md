# Printing to the console!

---
## Content

One of Python's simplest directives is the `print` directive. When executed, it prints out the stringified version of whatever we passed into it, and then appends a new line under that.

In Python 2, `print` is invoked without parentheses:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

To print in Python 3, we have to use parentheses:

```python
print('Python 3')
```
