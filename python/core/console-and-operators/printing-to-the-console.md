# Printing to the console!

---
## Content

Python's simplest directive is the `print` directive. It simply prints out a line, and incorporates a new line.

In Python 2, print is invoked without parentheses. Therefore, to `print` in Python 2:
```python
print 'Python 2'
```

To print in Python 3, use parentheses as `print()` is a function:

```python
print('Python 3')
```

## Practice

Pythons simplest directive is the ??? directive. It prints out the stringified version of whatever is passed in, and then a ???.

* `print`
* `new line`
* `python`
* `tab`
