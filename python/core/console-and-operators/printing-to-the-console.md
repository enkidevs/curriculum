## Content

Python's simplest directive is the `print` directive, it simply prints out a line, and incorporates a new line.

In Python 2, print is *not* a function and therefore is invoked without parentheses. Therefore, to print in Python 2:
```python
print 'Python 2'
```

To print in Python 3, you must use parentheses as print is a function:

```python
print('Python 3')
```
