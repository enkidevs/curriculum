# `if...else` statements


---

## Content

Control flow is the *order* in which individual statements or functions are executed. Control flow statements give *choices* that result in *different outcomes*.

> The `if...else` statement is used in Python for this decision making.

```python
if <condition>:
  <execute this code>
```

The program will only execute the code *if the condition has been met*.

```python
num = 3
if num > 0:
    print(num, " is a positive number")
```

The code above will print `'3 is a positive number'`.

The `if` statement can be extended to include a *catch-all*, `else`, that will be executed if the condition is not met.

```python
num = -1
if num >= 0:
    print("Positive or Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

The code above will print `'Negative number'`.

> As you may have spotted, we can use *comparison operators* to create conditions in Python.

Comparison operators include:

`==` - *is equal to*
`!=` - *is not equal to*
`<` - *is less than*
`<=` - *is less than or equal to*
`>` - *is greater than*
`>=` - *is greater than or equal to*

Note that a single `=` is used for assigning values to variables, not for comparison.
