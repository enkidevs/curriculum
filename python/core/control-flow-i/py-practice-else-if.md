# Python Control Flow Exercise

## Exercise

Click *Launch Exercise* to open a Python Tutor page.


This exercise introduces the `elif` keyword. In this construction, if the `if` statement evaluates to false, the executor will next check the condition of the `elif` statement. Any number of `elif`s can be chained together; the code block will continue to execute until a true condition is found. Once the code associated with the true condition is executed, the program will skip the rest of the `if/else` block.

After you have executed the Python Tutor code once (it should print `elif!`), change the value of `x` so that the program prints `else!` instead.
