# Chain comparison operators

---
## Content

In Python we're able to chain operators. This means that we can use more than one at a time, like this:

```python
x = 10

1 < x < 15
# True
```

Chaining operators is equivalent to:

```python
x = 10

1 < x  and x < 15
# True
```

## Practice

How do you check whether the value of the integer `x` is at least 2 and no more than 10?

???

* 1 < x < 11
* 2 < x < 10
* 2 < x < 11
* 1 < x < 10

```
a = 9

1 < a < 8
???
```

* `False`
* `True`

## Quiz

### Do you know how to use chained comparison operators?


How would we use chain comparison operators to express this conditional statement?

```python
if x >= y and x <= y:
    ...
```

- `if y <= x <= z:`
- `if y <= and x <= z:`
- `if (y <= and x <= z):`
- `if y >= x <= z:`
