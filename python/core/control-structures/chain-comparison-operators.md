# Chain comparison operators

---

## Content

Python provides a syntactic shortcut for chaining comparison operators.

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> 1 < x < 15
True
```

Is the equivalent of:

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> 1 < x  && x < 15
True
```

---

## Practice

Check if `x` is at least 2 and maximum 10:

???

- > > > 1 < x < 11
- > > > 2 < x < 10
- > > > 2 < x < 11
- > > > 1 < x < 10

## Quiz

### Do you know how to use chained comparison operators?

How would we use chained comparison operators to express this conditional statement?

```python
if var >= startvar and var <= endvar:
    ...
```

- `if startvar <= var <= endvar:`
- `if startvar <= and var <= endvar:`
- `if (startvar <= and var <= endvar):`
- `if startvar >= var <= endvar:`
