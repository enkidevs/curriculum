# `if` statements

---
## Content

Python uses *booleans* to evaluate conditions. A boolean variable has two values, true and false, and one of these will be returned once a condition has been evaluated.

The `=` character can be combined with itself and other characters for a number of uses:
- `=` is used for variable assignment
- `==` is used for a boolean comparison
- `!=` means is not equal to

For example:

```python
# variable declaration and assignment
num = 6

# returns and prints true
print(num == 6)

# returns and prints false
print(num < 4)

# returns and prints true
print(num != 12)
```

Such conditions can be used to manipulate the execution of the program, through `if` statements:

```python
if (condition):
    doSomething()
```

An `if` statement is a conditional operator, where if a condition is true then a certain piece of code will run, and if it's not true then this code won't run.

For example:

```python
x = 3
if (x < 5):
   print 'True!'
```
`if` statements can be extended to have an `else` statement. The standard python syntax for this is:

```python
if (condition):
    doSomething()
else:
    doSomethingElse()
```
The `else` part of the statement will run if the if condition evaluates to be false. For example:

```python
x = 3
if (x > 5):
    print('x is greater than 5!')
else:
    print('x is not greater than 5!')
```
