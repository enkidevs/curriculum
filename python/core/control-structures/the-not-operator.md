# The `not` operator

---
## Content

Using Python's `not` operator pre boolean expression will simply negate it.

Therefore:

```python
not (x > y) # is True if
(x > y)     # is False
```

For example:

```python
print(not False)
# prints True

print(True == (not True))
# prints False
```

## Revision

What does the following code snippet return:

```python
print(True == (not True))
```
???
