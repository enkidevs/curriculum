# Calling functions


---
## Content

To call a function in Python, you write the function's name followed by some brackets `()`.

For example:

```python
# To define
def new_func():
    print ('Function time!')

# To call
new_func()

```
Gives the following output:

```
Function time!
```

A parameter in Python is a variable which can be passed into functions so that methods can be performed onto it.

In this example, variable `x` is passed into the function as a parameter:

```python
def func(x):
    ans = x * x
    print(ans)
```
So to call this function, you must pass a parameter into your function call as follows:
```python
num = 5
func(num)
```
In the example, variable `x` will take the value of `num`, therefore the output will be:
```
25
```

## Practice

Find the arithmetic mean of `x` and `y`:

```python
x = 4
y = 2
??? mean(a, b):
    print((a + b) / 2)

???(???)
```

* def
* mean
* x, y
* (x, y)

## Revision

Complete the code snippet to define and call the function with the correct parameter:

```
??? cube(x):
    res = x * x * x
    print (res)

num = 5
???(???)
```

* `def`
* `cube`
* `num`
* `x`
* `new`
* `obj`
* `var`
* `function`
