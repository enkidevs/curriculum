# Defining Functions

---
## Content

Functions allow you to split up your code into relevant blocks, they allow code to be ordered and to be more readable.

Functions in Python use Python's standard block syntax:

```python
block-head:
    block line 1
    block line 2
```

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, and as explained above follow Python's block syntax, in the example below a function called `new_function` is defined with a simple print method inside:

```python
def new_function():
    print('Function defined!')
```

## Practice

Which of the following syntaxes is correct for defining Python functions:

```python
def function1():
    # function code…

def function2() {
    # function code…
}

def function 3(
    # function code…
}

def function 4()
    # function code…
```
???


* `Function 1`
* `Function 2`
* `Function 3`
* `Function 4`
