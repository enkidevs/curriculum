# The `return` statement

---
## Content

Python's `return` statement exits a function and passes back an expression to the function caller. It is used to return the *flow of control* with an *output result* to the function call.

A return statement without any arguments is the same as returning `None`, which is a special type in Python which represents 'nothing'.

All Python functions implicitly contain a `return None` statement at the end unless you have written your return statement.

Here is an example using a return statement:

```python
def return_func():
    print ('Print!')
    return 'Return!'

print(return_func())
```
Gives the following output:
```
Print!
Return!
```

## Practice

Fill in the following method such that it will return the sum of `x` and `y`:

```python

def sum():
  x = 5
  y = 7
  sum = ???
  ??? ???

```

* x + y
* return
* sum
* sum()
* x
* y
