# `Dictionary` - standard mapping type

---
## Content

The **dictionary** (dict) is Python's main mapping type. It maps **hashable** values to arbitrary objects.

They behave similar to *lists*, being easily grown or shrunk by adding or removing elements. The two important differences are that items stored in **dictionaries** can only be accessed using their key, and each key can only point to a single value. We call this **key integrity**. The Python dictionary's correspondent in Java is the *HashMap*; in C they are called *hash tables*, and in JavaScript, they are called *objects*.


There are several ways to create a *dictionary*:
- using the `{key: value}` syntax
- with the `dict` constructor
- with both the above syntax and constructor together

```python
d1 = {'first':1, 'second':2}
d2 = dict(first=1, second=2)
d3 = dict({'first':1, 'second':2})
```

This is how we access elements:
```python
print(d1['first'])
# 1
print(d2)
# {'second': 2, 'first': 1}
```


One interesting feature *dictionaries* have is the `update()` method. It behaves similarly to a concatenation of two lists, but with a few differences. Basically, it merges the keys and values from one dictionary into another and overwrites values of the same key:
```python
prefs = {"fruit": "apple", "car": "Tesla"}
prefs2 = {"fruit": "pear","animal": "dog"}
prefs.update(prefs2)
print(prefs)
# {'car': 'Tesla', 'fruit': 'pear',
# "animal": "dog"}
```

Be careful when using `update`, as a dictionary can not have multiple entries with the same key.

## Practice

Fill in the following snippet, such that it will output the value of key "dog":

```python

animals = {"cat": "persian", "dog": "pug"}
???(animals???)
```

* print
* ["dog"]
* ["cat"]
* ("dog")

## Revision

Which of the following is __not__ a valid syntax for creating a Python dictionary?
```
???
```

* `['first':1, 'second':2]`
* `dict(first=1, second=2)`
* `dict({'first':1, 'second':2})`
* `dict.fromkeys(('first', 'second'))`
