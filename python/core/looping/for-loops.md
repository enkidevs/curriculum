# `for` loops

---
## Content

`for` loops are used in most programming languages to iterate over a defined sequence.

The standard Python for loop syntax is:
```python
for iterating_num in sequence:
    doSomething()
```

An example `for` loop:

```python
for letter in 'Enki':
    print('Letter: ', letter)
```
Gives output:
```python
Letter:  E
Letter:  n
Letter:  k
Letter:  i
```
In the following example, `x` acts as the iterator and is incremented with each loop:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]

for x in nums:
    print(x)
```
Gives output:
```python
1
2
3
```

## Practice

What’s the output of the following code snippet:

```
for x in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    if (x % 2 == 0):
        print(x)
```
???


* `0 2 4`
* `0 1 2 3 4 5`
* `2 4`
* `1 3 5`
