  Typo in title - fixed.


  This uses sets where not needed, unless want to reducing the list to unique
  values.


  Error: reverse() is used, there is no such

  function (though there is a list method of that name, but it does not work in
  this context)


  The "reversed()" function (note extra "d" at end of name) should be used
  instead of "reverse()". Fixed.

# Looping techniques

---
## Content

Python has multiple techniques for looping over data structures.

**Dictionary** looping with both `key` and `value` can be done using the `items()` method:
```python
my_dict = {'first': 'a', 'second': 'b'}
for k, v in my_dict.items():
    print(k, v)
#first a
#second b
```
The `enumerate()` function allows looping with both `index` and `value` through any **sequence**:
```python
my_list = ['a', 'b']
for i, v in enumerate(my_list):
    print(i, v)
# 0 a
# 1 b
```
`zip()` function can be used to pair two or more **sequences** in order to loop over both of them in parallell:
```python
first_list = ['a', 'b']
second_list = ['one', 'two']
for f, s in zip(first_list, second_list):
    print(f, s)
# a one
# b two
```

To loop in a sorted order, use the `sorted()` function:

```python
my_list = ['b', 'c', 'a']
for f in sorted(my_list):
    print(f)
# a
# b
# c
```

To loop in reverse, pass the sorted `list` to the `reversed()` function:
```python
for f in reversed(sorted(set(my_list))):
  print(f)
# c
# b
# a
```

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to pair the sequences in order and loop over them both in parallel:

```python
list_a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list_one = ['one', 'two', 'three']
for k, v in ???(list_a, list_one):
    print(???)

//Expected output:
// a one
// b two
// c three
```

* `zip`
* `k, v`
* `f, s`
* `pair`
* `parallel`
* `list_a, list_one`

## Revision

Complete the code snippet to loop through the list in reverse and then print it out:

```
enki_list = ['i', 'k', 'n', 'e']
for w in ???(???):
    ???(w)   

```

* `reversed`
* `enki_list`
* `print`
* `output`
* `reverse`
* `orderreverse`
* `start`
* `list`
