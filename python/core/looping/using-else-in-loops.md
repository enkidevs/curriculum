# Using `else` in loops

---
## Content

Unlike other programming languages such as C, Python allows the use of `else` statements with loops.

They are implemented so once a `for` or `while` loops condition evaluates to false, the `else` is executed. In other words, the `else` statement is called **once** when loops exit naturally.

For example, an `else` statement integrated into a `while` loop:
```python
x = 0
while (x < 3):
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
else:
    print(x, "is too big!")
```
Gives the following output:

```python
0
1
2
3 is too big!
```

Also, an `else` statement integrated into a `for` loop in a similar example:

```python
for x in range(0, 5):
    print(x)
else:
    print(x, "is range's upper limit")
```
Gives the following output:
```python
0
1
2
3
4
4 is range's upper limit
```

If loops exit because of a `break` clause, the `else` clause will be skipped:
```python
for i in range(0, 2):
    if i == 1:
        print("a")
        break
    print("b")
else:
    print("c")
```
With the output:
```python
b
a
```

## Practice

Fill in the following snippet such that it will return *"Computation Done"* when the while terminates:

```python
x = 0
while x ??? 3:
    print("running")
    x += 1
???:
    ???("Computation Done")
```

* `<`
* else
* print
* `>`
* if
* elif

## Revision

An `else` statement is used in loops when the loops ??? is evaluated to ???.

* condition
* false
* null
* true
* statement
* parameter

## Quiz
### what will the following code snippet print?

```python
for i in [1, 2]:
    if i == 1:
        print("a")
        break
    print("b")
else:
    print("c")
```

 ???

* a
* a a
* b a
* a c
