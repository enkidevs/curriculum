# `while` loops

---
## Content

Python's `while` loops repeatedly loop and execute some code *while* a boolean statement evaluates to true.

The standard `while` loop syntax is:

```python
while condition:
    doSomething()
```

While the condition evaluates to *true*, the code inside the loop is executed. As soon as the condition evaluates to *false*, the loop is exited and the code immediately following the loop is executed.

For example:

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
```
Gives the following output:

```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

---
## Practice

Print the  all numbers in 0..10 _inclusive_:
```python
x = 0
while x < ???:
  ???
  ???
```

* 11
* print(x)
* x += 1
* 10
* x++
* x+1

## Revision

Whatâ€™s the output of the following code snippet:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
     x += 1
     print(x)
```
???


* `1 2 3 4 5`
* `0 1 2 3 4`
* `1 2 3 4`
* `0 1 2 3 4 5`
