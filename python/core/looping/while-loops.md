# `while` loops

---
## Content

Python's `while` loops repeatedly loop and execute some code *whilst* a boolean statements evaluates to true.

The standard `while` loop syntax is:

```python
while condition:
    doSomething()
```

Whilst the condition evaluates to *true*, the code inside the loop is executed, as soon as the condition evaluates to *false* the loop is exited and the code immediately following the loop is executed.

For example:

```python
counter = 0
while (counter < 5):
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
```
Gives the following output:

```python
0
1
2
3
4
```
