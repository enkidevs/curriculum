# `while` loops

---

## Content

Python's `while` loops repeatedly loop and execute some code *while* a boolean statement evaluates to true.

The standard `while` loop syntax is:

```python
while condition:
    doSomething()
```

While the condition evaluates to *true*, the code inside the loop is executed. As soon as the condition evaluates to *false*, the loop is exited and the code immediately following the loop is executed.

For example:

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1
```

Gives the following output:

```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

## Practice

Print the all numbers between 0 and 10 *inclusive*:

```python
x = 0
while x < ???:
  ???
  ???
```

- 11
- print(x)
- x = x + 1
- 10
- x++
- x + 1

## Revision

Whatâ€™s the output of the following code snippet:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x = x + 1
    print(x)
```

???

- `1 2 3 4 5`
- `0 1 2 3 4`
- `1 2 3 4`
- `0 1 2 3 4 5`
