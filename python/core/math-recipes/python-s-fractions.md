# Python's `fractions`

---
## Content

Support for rational number arithmetic can be achieved using Python's  `fractions` module.

Import the module:
```python
import fractions
```
The `Fraction` constructor can take either a pair of integers, a rational number or a string:
```python
a = fractions.Fraction(16,-10)
print(a) # -8/5
b = fractions.Fraction('3/7')
print(b) # 3/7
```
The `Fraction` class inherits all operations available in the abstract `numbers.Rational`  class.

In addition, the `fractions` module provides a way to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers:
```python
print(fractions.gcd(25,75))
#  25
```

Keep in mind that with the release of Python 3.5, this method is deprecated and `math.gcd()` should be used.

## Practice

Create a fraction, using the `fractions` module:
```
a = ???.???(5,-2)
print(a) #-5/2
```

```
???.???(30, 90)
```
