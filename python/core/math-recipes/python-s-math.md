  Math modules workout.
  Notes by Vasudev:
  All stdlib modules are always available,
  so the math module is not special in
  this regard. So correct the opening
  sentence, by removing the words "every
  time - available".  Also change the word
  "specialized" to "common" - because there
  is nothing very special about the functions
  in the math module, they are normal math
  functions.  Correct line spacing between
  titles and items in insight.  Confirm usage
  of modf and also mention fmod and the
  difference between them.

# Python's `math`

---
## Content

The `math` module provides the user with mathematical functions common in the C standard library.

Import the module:
```python
import math
#constants
print(math.pi) # Number PI
print(math.e) # Euler's number
```

Check if a value is `Nan` or `INF`:
```python
math.isnan(var)
math.isinf(var)

```

You can get a `tuple` containing the fractional and whole number parts of a number:
```python
print(math.modf(4.4))
# (0.4, 4.0)
```
Factorial and gamma (factorial for real numbers) operations can be calculated:
```python
math.factorial(intNr)
math.gamma(realNr)

``` 

Trigonometric functions:
```pyton
math.sin(x)
math.atan(x)
```
Angular conversions:
```python
math.degrees(x) # radians to degrees
math.radians(x) # degrees to radians
```

Power and logarithmic functions:
```python
math.exp(x) # returns e**x
math.log(x[,base]) # base is by default e
math.pow(x,y) # returns x^y
```

---
## Practice

Check if `var` has the `INF` value:
```
import math

???.???(var)
```


* `math` 
* `isinf` 
* `mathematics` 
* `is_inf` 
* `infinite`

## Revision

Using the `math`  module, assign to `a` the value of `PI` :
```
a = ???.???
```


* `math` 
* `pi` 
* `constants` 
* `e` 
* `3.14`
