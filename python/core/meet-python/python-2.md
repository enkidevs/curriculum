## Content

### Python 2

The final version of Python 2, version 2.7, came out in 2010. Although Python 3 is the latest generation of the language, many programmers still use Python 2.7.

One advantage of Python 2 is that it has been around longer than Python 3, so there's more technical support and help available.

One minor difference between Python 2 and 3 is that in Python 2, `print` is treated as a statement instead of a function, therefore there's no need to pass arguments through parentheses; for example:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

### Python 3

Python 3 was released in 2008 with the goal of making Python easier language to use.

In Python 3, you must pass the items you want to print explicitly to the function in parentheses as follows:
```python
print ('Python 3')
```

Python 3 is the first Python release which is incompatible with previous Python versions, which is why some programmers still use Python 2, since certain packages and libraries they rely on do not work with Python 3.

Python 3 is considered to be an improved version of Python 2, with fewer mistakes, and easier for beginners to understand and use. Our goal is for you to learn the newest version.

As a beginner, your best bet is **Python 3**. This is the standard that's advancing slightly faster and you won't have to worry about porting Python 2 applications to Python 3.
