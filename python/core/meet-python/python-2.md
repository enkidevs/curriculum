# Python versions

## Content

### Python 2

The final version of Python 2 came out in 2010, and despite Python 3 being the latest generation of the language, many programmers still use this Python version, 2.7.

Another advantage of Python 2 is that it has been around for far longer than Python 3, therefore there's more technical support and help available.

One minor difference between Python 2 and 3 is that in Python 2, `print` is treated as a statement instead of a function, therefore there's no need to pass arguments through parentheses; for example:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

### Python 3

Python 3 was released in 2008 with the goal to simply make Python an easier language to use.

The goal of this new Python version was to also change the way the language handles strings, consequently enabling it to meet the demands of the language today.

Python 3 is the first Python release which is incompatible with previous Python versions, which is why some people still use Python 2, as they find some packages and libraries not working for the latest Python version!

One difference is that in Python 3, you must pass the items you want to print explicitly to the function in parentheses as follows:
```python
print ('Python 3')
```

Python 3 is considered to be an improved version of Python 2, with fewer mistakes, and easier for beginners to understand and use. Our goal is for you to learn the newest version.

As a beginner, your best bet is **Python 3**. This is the standard that's advancing slightly faster and you don't have to worry at all about porting a whole Python 2 application to Python 3 (the main reason why Python 2 hung around for so long).
