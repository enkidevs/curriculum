# Python environment

---
## Content

Python comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions and is available as packages or installers on all others operating systems. Everything you need can be found on:
```
www.python.org/downloads
```

After installing Python, fire up a new terminal (Unix/MacOS) or a PowerShell (Windows) in order to run the Python REPL shell:
```bash
$ python3
# Python 3.5.2
# (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23)
# [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or
#  "license" for more information.
>>> quit()
$
```
**REPL** stands for *Read-Eval-Print Loop* which evaluates each line of code you write and outputs the result. Even though it may sound like something new, it is not: you just invoked the Python REPL from another REPL application - the shell inside the terminal.

You won't use the REPL interpreter for longer snippets of code, however. It is much easier to write Python code using a text editor. There are a lot of options here: Atom, Emacs, Vim, Sublime, each with its advantages and disadvantages. We are going to recommend you to use Atom, as it is simple to use and highly customizable.

To run Python file, it should firstly have the `.py` extension. Then, invoke a new terminal inside the directory and write:
```bash
$ python3 myNewPython.py
```
The process couldn't be simpler!
