# Python Environment

---
## Content

Python comes pre-installed on most operating systems. It can also be downloaded online for free.

Once installed, you can type `python3`, `python` or `python -i` to run the **Python interpreter**[1] from the shell[2]:

```bash
python3
# Python 3.7.6
# (default, Dec 30 2019, 19:38:28)
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or
#  "license" for more information.
>>>
```

This gives you a local interactive environment where you can run Python code and output the results.

> The Python interpreter is your **playground**. So test things, go crazy!

It is the ideal place for testing out small pieces of code or calculations.

For example:

```bash
python3
>>> 3 * 4
# 12
>>>
```

> For anything longer than a few lines of code, it's much easier to use a text editor.

Some of the most popular text editors are Notepad, Atom, VIM, Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for beginners. 

Once you're using a text editor you can save files using a `.py` extension and then open them from the shell by running:

```bash
python3 myPythonFile.py
```

## Footnotes

[1:Python Interpreter]
The Python interpreter is the application that runs your Python script. 

The interpreter is a quick way to explore Python and try out code without creating a file. It is a Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, a tool offered by many modern programming languages. 

To use it, you launch the Python interpreter with `python3`, `python` or `python -i` and type your Python code at the prompt. The interpreter evaluates the code you type and displays the results.

[2:Shell]
The shell, also known as the command line, is a program which processes shell scripts, like Bash. Shell scripts allow you to manipulate and navigate between files, execute programs, and print text. The shell is run through the terminal.
