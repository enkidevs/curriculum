# Hello World!

---
## Content

We can write our first Python3 program, and print Hello World to the console!

To do this, in our Python3 interpreter (REPL), we can use Python's print function as follows:

```python
>>> print('Hello World!')
```

This produces the following output:

```python
# Hello World!
```

---

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet such that it respects python3 syntax:

```python
print ???
```

* (Enki)
* : Enki
* Enki

---
## Revision

```
???('Python with Enki!')
```

* `print`
* `write`
* `sys.out`
* `writeln`
