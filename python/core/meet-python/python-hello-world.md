# Hello World!


---

## Content

Let's write our first Python program, and print `Hello World!` to our screen!

To do this, in the Python interpreter, use Python's print function as follows:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

The output displayed in the shell is:

```python
# Hello World!
```

In this program, we've used Python's built-in `print` function. Soon you'll learn about many more of these built-in functions and how to create your own.

## Practice

Let's practice using Python! Which statement will display `'Enki'`?

```python

```

- `print('Enki')`
- `: 'Enki'`
- `puts 'Enki'`
- `console.log('Enki')`

## Revision

Complete the code snippet with the correct function to write `'Python with Enki!'` to the shell:

```plain-text
???('Python with Enki!')
```

- `print`
- `write`
- `sys.out`
- `writeln`
