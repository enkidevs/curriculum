# Hello World!

---
## Content

We can write our first Python program, and print Hello World to the console!

To do this, in our Python interpreter (REPL), we can use Python's print method as follows:

```python
>>> print('Hello World!')
```

Note that `print` as a method whom you pass arguments to is specific syntax to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x `print` is a statement and it can be used as follows:

```python
>>> print 'Hello World!'
```

This produces the following output:

```python
# Hello World!
```
