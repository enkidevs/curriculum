We can write our first Python program, and print Hello World to the console!

To do this, in our Python interpreter (REPL), we can use Python's print method as follows:

```python
>>> print('Hello World!')
```

Note that `print` as a method whom you pass arguments to is specific syntax to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x `print` is a statement and it can be used as follows:

```python
>>> print 'Hello World!'
```

This produces the following output:

```python
# Hello World!
```
