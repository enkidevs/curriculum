# Hello World!

---
## Content

We can write our first Python3 program, and print Hello World to the console!

To do this, in our Python3 interpreter (REPL), we can use Python's print function as follows:

```python
>>> print('Hello World!')
```

Note that `print` as a method whom you pass arguments to is specific syntax to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x `print` is a statement and it can be used as follows:

```python
>>> print 'Hello World!'
```

This produces the following output:

```python
# Hello World!
```

## Practice

Update the following code snippet to be compatible with python3:

```python
print ???
```

* (Enki)
* : Enki
* Enki

---
## Revision

Complete the code snippet with the correct function:

```
???('Python with Enki!')
```

* `print`
* `write`
* `sys.out`
* `writeln`
