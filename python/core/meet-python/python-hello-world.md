# Hello World!

---
## Content

We can write our first Python3 program, and print `Hello World!` to the console!

To do this, in the Python3 interpreter (REPL), use Python's print function as follows:

```python
>>> print('Hello World!')
```

Note that `print` as a method which you pass arguments to is specific syntax to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x `print` is a statement and would be used as follows:

```python
>>> print 'Hello World!'
```

In both cases, the output is as follows:

```python
# Hello World!
```

## Practice

Let's practice using Python! Which statement will log "Enki" in the terminal?

```python
???
```

* `print('Enki')`
* `: 'Enki'`
* `>> 'Enki'`
* `console.log('Enki')`

## Revision

Complete the code snippet with the correct function to write the string 'Python with Enki!' to the REPL shell:

```
???('Python with Enki!')
```

* `print`
* `write`
* `sys.out`
* `writeln`
