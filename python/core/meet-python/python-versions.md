# Python Versions


---

## Content

You'll be learning **Python 3** for this course as it's the latest and best version.

Python 3 is easier for beginners to understand, and is being updated frequently so there are fewer bugs. 

In the latest version of Python, text is printed as follows:

```python
print('Python 3')
```

In older versions, text is printed like this:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

Python 3 treats `print` as a function rather than a statement, so you must pass items that you want printed in parentheses.

Some programmers still use versions of Python 2, with 2.7 being the last major release.

Since the start of 2020 Python HQ are no longer working on improvements to Python 2 and have advised everyone to switch over to Python 3.
