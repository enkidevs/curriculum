# What is Python?

---
## Content

Python is a *high-level*, *interpreted*, *interactive* and *object-oriented* programming language.

It's designed to be easily readable, using English keywords and straightforward syntax. For example, here's the `print` method in Python 3:

```python
print ('Learning Python with Enki!')
```

Python is processed at runtime by the *interpreter*, which means that Python programs don't need to be compiled pre-execution.

The interactive side to Python means you can use a Python prompt to *interact* with the interpreter directly to create programs!

Since Python is an object-orientated programming language, it supports an object-orientated style of programming which *encapsulates*[1] code within objects.

## Footnotes
[1:encapsulates]
Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept. It refers to the practice of wrapping the data, variables, and methods (code that acts on the data) together as a single unit.
