# What is Python?

---
## Content

Python is a *high-level*, *interpreted*, *interactive* and *object-oriented* programming language.

It's designed to be easily readable as it frequently uses English keywords and few syntactical constructions. Here's the `print` method for example:

```python
print ('Learning Python with Enki!')
```

Python is processed at `runtime` by the interpreter, which means that Python programs don't need to be compiled pre-execution.

The interactive side to Python means you can use a Python prompt to `interact` with the interpreter directly to create programs!

Since Python is an object-orientated programming language, it supports an object-orientated style of programming which `encapsulates`[1] code within objects.
