# Why learn Python?

---
## Content

Python was designed in a way that is easy to understand and to read. It uses English keywords and doesn't require long variable declarations or the use of curly brackets for functions and classes.

For example, a `for` loop in Python using self-explained English keywords:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
for i in items:
    print (i)

# Output: 1 2 3
```

Python is also an economical programming language. For similar tasks, Python can often require *3-5* times less code than Java, and up to *10* times less code than C++. 

As we know, Python is an *object orientated* programming language, therefore because of Python's object orientated nature it can act as a stepping stone to learning new object orientated languages, and can help you adapt to other programming environments.
