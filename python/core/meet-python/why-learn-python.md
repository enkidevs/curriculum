2. It's a **powerful language for data science**

Python is the preferred language for Data Science and Machine Learning. Both areas with exciting work and a growing demand for jobs.

3. A huge community of **web developers** use it

## Footnotes

[1:Object-oriented programming]
All you need to know for now is that **object-oriented programming** (OOP) is a *programming pattern* that works with real-life entities. These entities are called **objects**, and they have *attributes* and *behaviors*. 

Let's use the common car analogy to better understand OOP. 

Think of the car as the object. The model, color or age of the car are the object's *attributes*. Whether the engine is on, or whether it's moving are *behaviors* and would exist as functions.
