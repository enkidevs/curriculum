# Why learn Python?

---
## Content

Python was designed to be understand and read. It uses English keywords and meaningful white space and does not require typed variable declarations.


For example, a `for` loop in Python uses self-explanatory English keywords:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
for i in items:
    print (i)

# Output: 1 2 3
```

Python is also an economical programming language. For similar tasks, Python can often require *3-5* times less code than Java, and up to *10* times less code than C++.

As a highly readable, object-oriented programming language, Python can act as a stepping-stone to learning other object-oriented languages.
