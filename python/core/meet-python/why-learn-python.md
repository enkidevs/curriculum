# Why learn Python?

---

## Content

Python was designed in a way that is easy to understand and to read be the human eye. It uses English keywords and doesn't require long variable declarations or the use of curly brackets for functions and classes.

For example, a `for` loop in Python using self-explained English keywords:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
for i in items:
    print (i)

# Output: 1 2 3
```

Python is also an economical programming language. For similar tasks, Python can often require _3-5_ times less code than Java, and up to _10_ times less code than C++.

Python is an _object-oriented_ programming language, therefore it can act as a stepping stone to learning new object-oriented languages, and can help you adapt to other programming environments.
