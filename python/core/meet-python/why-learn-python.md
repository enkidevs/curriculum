# Why learn Python?

---
## Content

Python was designed in a way that is easy to understand and read. It uses English keywords and doesn't require long variable declarations or the use of curly brackets for functions and classes.


For example, a `for` loop in Python using self-explained English keywords:

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
for i in items:
    print (i)

# Output: 1 2 3
```

Python is also an economical programming language. For similar tasks, Python can often require *3-5* times less code than Java, and up to *10* times less code than C++.

As we know, Python is an *object oriented* programming language, therefore because of Python's object oriented nature it can act as a stepping stone to learning new object oriented languages, and can help you adapt to other programming environments. Nonetheless, Python is also used as functional programming language in certain conditions.
