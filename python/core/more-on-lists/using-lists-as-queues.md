# Using Lists as Queues

---
## Content

It's appropriate to create a **new class** to help implement an **abstract data type** such as a **queue**. We will use **list** data structures this time.

**Queues** are abstract data structures that follow the principle of **first in, first out** (FIFO) when adding or removing an element.

The addition of elements is called **enqueue** and every new element is inserted at the back of the queue. The oposite action is called **dequeue** and it returns the first element from the queue.


Let's define a **queue** class now:

```
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.items == []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.insert(0,item)

    def dequeue(self):
        return self.items.pop()

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)
```

As you can see, we defined 5 **methods**:
- the **constructor**, which creates a **new empty list**
- a method that checks whether the **queue is empty**
- a method `enqueue`, which adds an element to the **back of the queue**
- a method `dequeue`, which removes an element from the **front of the queue**
- a method `size`, which returns the size of the **queue**

## Practice

Using the `Queue` module we defined before. We want to print out the `2017` number. Fill the gaps accordingly:
```
import __

my_queue = Queue()

my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)

for n in __.items:
    print(n)
```
???


* Queue, 7, 1, 0, 2, my_queue
* queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue
* Queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue

## Revision

What will the output generated by the following snippet look like?
```
import Queue

temp = Queue()

temp.enqueue('Q')
temp.enqueue('U')
temp.enqueue('E')
temp.enqueue('U')
temp.enqueue('E')

print(temp.size())

for n in temp.items:
    print(n)
```
???


* 5 E U E U Q
* 5 Q U E U E
* Q U E U E
* E U E U Q
