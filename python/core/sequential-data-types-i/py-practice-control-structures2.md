# Practice With Python Control Structures

## Exercise

Click *Launch Exercise* to open this exercise in Codewars.

On the website you will find a description of the exercise.

This exercise introduces the concept of *functions*. Functions can take an input (like a number or a string),
use it for something, and return an output. The output can be differ depending on the value of the input,
and the job of the function is to produce the correct output for the given input.

There are many solutions to this CodeWars kata, but for this exercise, you should approach it as a two-step problem.

First, use the person's age to assign them to the correct group.
Then, create a dictionary with the age groups ('kids', 'teens', etc) as the keys, and the return strings ('drinks toddy', etc) as the values.
Use the person's age group to look up the appropriate string in the dictionary.

When you are ready to give it a try press the blue *Train* button and write your solution.

To test your solution press the blue *Attempt* button.
