# The `tuple`

---
## Content

Tuples are another **sequential** and **immutable** data type.

They're used to *group any number of items*, regardless of their type, into a *single value*.

> A tuple is created by separating items with commas, and are often wrapped in optional parentheses `()` to make them stand out.

```python
my_first_tuple = ('first', 1, '1', 1.0)
```

Again, we can extract elements from tuples using the index operator, and items cannot be reassigned:

```python
print(my_first_tuple[3])
# 1.0

my_first_tuple[0] = 'First'
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Tuples are mostly used when we need to store values of multiple different types, such as for database fields or CSV column names.

## Practice

Extract the element `'pie'` from the tuple:

```python
pie_tuple = ('pie', 3.14, 'pi', 3)

print(???[???])
```

* `pie_tuple`
* `0`
* `'pie'`
* `1`
* `'tuple'`


---
## Revision

Extract the element `'Enki'` from the tuple:

```python
my_tuple = ('Python', 1, 'Enki', 2)

print(???[???])
```

* `my_tuple`
* `2`
* `my_tuple.find`
* `my_tuple.search`
* `3`
* `1`
