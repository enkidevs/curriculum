# Dictionary Methods

---
## Content

Consider the following dictionary:

```python
a_dict = {
  1: 1,
  2: 4,
  3: 9, 
  4: 16, 
  5: 25
}
```

Python provides a plethora of **methods** intended for dictionaries manipulation:

- `clear()`: removes all items from the **dictionary**

```python
a_dict.clear()
print(a_dict)

# Output: {}
```

- `copy()` : returns a **shallow copy**[1] of the **dictionary**

```python
new = a_dict.copy()
print(new)

# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

- `get(key[, default])`[2]: returns the value mapped to the given key; if there's no item with that key, it'll return the optional argument `default`

```py
print(a_dict.get(3))

# Output: 9
```

- `items()`: returns a list composed of all dictionary entries expressed as tuples of the form `(key,value)`

```py
print(a_dict.items())

# Output:
# [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
```

- `keys()`: returns a list of all dictionary `key`s

```py
print(a_dict.keys())

# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

- `pop(key[, default])`: removes the item at the given position (`key`) in the list, and returns its value; if no item is found, the optional `default` argument will be returned

```py
a_dict.pop(4)
print(a_dict)

# Output:
# 16
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 5: 25}
```

- `popitem()`: removes an **arbitrary item** from the dictionary, and returns it; if the dictionary **is empty**, `KeyError` is returned 

```py
a_dict.popitem()
print(a_dict)

# Output:
# (5,25)
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
```

- `values()` : lists all the values present in the **dictionary**

```py
print(a_dict.values())

# Output:
# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

- `fromkeys(seq[, v])`: return a new **dictionary** with keys from `seq` and value equal to `v`

```py
a_dict = {}.fromkeys([1,2,3], 0)
print(a_dict)

# Output: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}
```

## Practice

Suppose we want to create a dictionary using the `fromkeys` method. Fill the gaps accordingly:
```py
new = ???.???(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ???)

print(new)

# Output:
# {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0}
```

* `{}`
* `fromkeys`
* `0`
* `1`
* `fromKeys`
* `values`
* `popitem`
* `clear`

---
## Revision

Print all of the keys from the dictionary:
```py
num_dict = {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25}

print(???)
```

* `num_dict.keys()`
* `keys(num_dict)`
* `num_dict_keys()`
* `keys_num_dict()`

## Footnotes
[1:Shallow Copy]
Shallow copies are used to duplicate the minimum amount necessary. Let's say we have a collection named `A`. If we were to make a **shallow copy** of it (named `B`), we would say that `B` represents a copy of `A`s structure, not `A`s elements. Now, both `A` and `B` point to (or share) the same elements that `A` initially had.

[2:Common notation]
When reading the definition of a method, if you see something like `method(foo[, bar])` it means that the `foo` argument is **mandatory**, and the `bar` argument is **optional**.
