notes: >-
  Insight contet is right. But should have a few examples that show the use of
  the various regular expression patterns, such as for matching either pattern1
  or pattern2, matching zero or one of some character, matching 2 to 4 of some
  character, etc.

# Regular expressions 

---
## Content

**Regular expressions** (re) are everywhere in programming. These text matching patterns are also available in Python via the `re` module.

Import the module:
```python
import re
```

Regular expressions make use of **special characters** that stand either for classes of normal chars or affect the interpretation of the *RE*.

For example the `ab?` re will match either `a`  or ` ab` while `ab*` will match `a`, `ab` or `a` followed by any numbers of `b`s.

The most common use of the `re` module is to search texts for specified patterns.
```python
text = 'Enki is cool'
if re.search('Enki', text):
    print("Found it!")
# output: Found it!
``` 

To find start and end indexes of your match:
```python
text = 'Enki is cool'
match = re.search('Enki', text)
print(match.start())
print(match.end())
# 0
# 4
```

## Practice

Search the given text for the `abc` pattern:

```
import re
text = “here is abc”
if ???.???(‘abc’, text)
   print(‘found’)
```

* `re` 
* `search` 
* `pattern` 
* `match` 
* `find` 
* `regex` 
* `reg`
