# Execution Order of Operators


---

## Content

When using more than one operator in Python, it's crucial to understand the *order* they'll be executed in.

What will be the result of the following expression?

```bash
>>> 2 + 9 * 4 / 3 - 5
# this expression is equivalent to:
# 2 + ((9*4)/3) - 5
# Result:
# 9.0
```

Here is the order of execution for Python's operators (highest to lowest):

| Operator            | Name                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `()`                | Parenthesis                                       |
| `**`                | Exponent                                          |
| `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` | Multiplication, division, floor division, modulus |
| `+`, `-`            | Addition, subtraction                             |
