# Complex Operators

---
## Content

Python uses the exponent operator, `**`, to multiply a number *to the power* of another.

```bash
>>> 2 ** 4
# 16
```

This code executes 2 to the power of 4.

Here are some other examples:

```bash
>>> -3 ** 4
# -81
>>> 2 ** -2
# 0.25
```

Note how the `**` operator is executed before the `-` in the first example, so the calculation is `-(3**4)`. More about this order of execution in the next insight!

Python uses the modulus operator, `%`, to return the *remainder of a division*.

```bash
>>> 14 % 3
# 2
```

14 divided by 3 equals 4 remainder 2. The modulus operator returns this remainder 2.
