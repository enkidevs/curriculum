# Doctest

---
## Content

**Doctest** enable users to test their code by running examples **embedded** in the program comments and verifying that they produce the expected output. 

We begin by importing the *doctest* module and defining a function:
```python
# doctest_mock.py
import doctest

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```
Then, define the tests inside the function's docstring[1]:
```python
# doctest_mock.py
import doctest

def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Test for numbers:

    >>> multiply(3,3)
    9

    Test for chars:

    >>> multiply('a',3)
    'aaa'
    >>> multiply('a',0)
    ''
    """

    return a * b

if __name__ == '__main__':
    doctest.testmod()

```

Text documentation (`"Test for numbers:"`, `"Test for chars:"`) isn't taken into account by **doctest**. The module looks for lines beginning with the interpreter prompt (`>>>`), which marks the start of a *test case*. Either a blank line or another interpreter prompt end the test case.

Running **doctests** without any flag won't generate any output if the *tests pass*, but if the `-v` flag is passed, a **detailed log** will be printed:
```bash
$ python doctest_mock.py -v
```
The output:
```python
Trying:
    multiply(3, 3)
Expecting:
    9
ok
Trying:
    multiply('a', 3)
Expecting:
    'aaa'
ok
Trying:
    multiply('a', 0)
Expecting:
    ''
ok
1 items had no tests:
    __main__
1 items passed all tests:
   3 tests in __main__.multiply
3 tests in 2 items.
3 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
```

## Revision

How does `doctest` find a new test case in the documentation?
???


* It searches for lines that begin with the interpreter prompt (`>>>`).
* It searches for any strings in the documentation.
* It knows that tests begin after an empty line.

## Footnotes
[1: docstring]
An object's docstring is defined by including a string constant (documentation) as the first
statement in the object's definition.
