# Following PEP 8 styling guideline.

---
## Content

The most common and standard styling guideline for Python is known as PEP 8.
It is designed to improve readability.

It can however be quite strict (e.g. in the case of whitespaces).
For instance, this is OK in PEP 8:
```
john = 1
ted = 2
fred = 3
```
but is not allowed:
```
john = 1
ted  = 2
fred = 3
```

Raymond Hettinger's word of wisdom:
"Do not PEP 8 unto others; only PEP 8 thy self.
Don't let PEP 8 make you insanely intolerant of other people's code."

To PEP 8 yourself, use a linter and an autoformatter. These 
exist for all the popular editors.
