# Dictionary Methods I

---
## Content

Python has tons of built-in methods for dictionaries. Let's explore some of the most commonly used!

Consider the following dictionary:

```python
square_numbers = {
  1: 1,
  2: 4,
  3: 9, 
  4: 16, 
  5: 25
}
```

- `clear()` removes all items from the dictionary

```python
square_numbers.clear()

print(square_numbers)
# {}
```

- `copy()` returns a **shallow copy**[1] of the dictionary

```python
new = square_numbers.copy()

print(new)
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

- `items()` returns a `list` of the dictionary items expressed as tuples `(key, value)`

```python
square_numbers.items()

# dict_items([(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)])
```

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet to make a duplicate of the variable `my_house` called `new_house`:

```python
my_house = {'bedrooms': 2, 'bathrooms': 2, 'garden': True}

new_house = ???.???
```

* `my_house`
* `copy()`
* `clone()`
* `copy`
* `duplicate()`

## Revision

What's the correct method to return the contents of a dictionary as a `list` of `tuples`?

```python
english_to_french = {'apple': 'pomme', 'orange': 'orange'}

english_to_french.???
# [('orange', 'orange'), ('apple', 'pomme')]
```

* `items()`
* `contents()`
* `keys()`
* `reduce()`

## Footnotes

[1:Shallow Copy]
Shallow copies duplicate the minimum amount necessary. Let's say we have a collection named `a`. If we were to make a **shallow copy** of it (named `b`), we would say that `b` represents a copy of `a`s structure, but not `a`s elements.
