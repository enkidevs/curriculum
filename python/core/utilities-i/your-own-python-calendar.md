# Your own Python `calendar` 

---
## Content

The Python `calendar` module defines the `Calendar` class. This is used for various date calculations as well as `TextCalendar` and `HTMLCalendar` classes with their `local` subclasses, used for rendering pre formatted output.

Import the module:
```python
import calendar
```

Print the current month:
```python
import calendar
year = 2016
month = 1
cal = calendar.month(year, month)
print(cal)


```
The output will look like this:
```
           January 2016
      Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
                   1  2  3
       4  5  6  7  8  9 10
      11 12 13 14 15 16 17
      18 19 20 21 22 23 24
      25 26 27 28 29 30 31


```
Set the first day of the week as Sunday:
```python
calendar.setfirstweekday(calendar.SUNDAY)
```
To print a whole year's calendar:
```python
print(calendar.calendar(2016))
```
Output not shown since it is too large.


This module provide other useful methods for working with dates, times and calendars such as `calendar.isleap` (checks if a year is a leap year).

## Practice

Set the first day of the week of your `calendar` to be Monday:

??

```
calendar.??? \
  (calendar.MONDAY) 
```

* `setfirstweekday` 
* `setweekday` 
* `setfirstday` 
* `firstweekday` 
* `firstday`

## Revision

Print the year 2016 using the python calendar:

```
import calendar
print(calendar.???(2016))
```


* `calendar` 
* `year` 
* `currentYear` 
* `annum`
