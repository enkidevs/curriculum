# Compare sequences with `difflib`

---
## Content

Another useful Python module  crafted for comparing sequences (even files and text) is `difflib`.

Import the module:
```python
import difflib
```

 It provides classes and functions such as `Differ` (for lines of text) or `HtmlDiff` to show the differences in a human readable form, like the Unix diff command.

To see the differences between two text strings (`text_A` and `text_B`) the `Differ`'s `compare` function can be used:
```python
text_A = """abcde \n fgh"""
text_B = """abcde \n ijk"""
d = difflib.Differ()
diff = d.compare(text_A, text_B)
print('\n'.join(diff))

```

This will print the whole text once again with differences highlighted by line with either `-` or `+` signs:
```python
# abcde are the same for both
# -f / -g / -h
# +i / +j / +k
```
The same result is achieved with `difflib.ndiff`. 

To show only the differences and some context:
```python
diff = difflib.unified_diff(text_A, text_B)
print('\n'.join(diff))
```

## Practice

Use `Differ` class to print the differences between texts `a` and `b`  :

```
import difflib
a = “abc \n xyz”
b = “abc \n plm”
d = difflib.???()
diff = d.???(a, b)
print(‘\n’.join(diff))
```

## Revision

What class from `difflib` with a `compare` method can be used to see differences between two text strings?

???


* `Differ`
* `SequenceMatcher`
* `ndiff`
