# Coroutine Utility function

---
## Content

Inside **Python**'s ` types`  module one can find the `coroutine` function since the introduction of **Python 3.5**. 

This function is used to transform a **generator function** into a **coroutine function**, returning a generator-based coroutine.

This coroutine is both a **generator iterator** and an ` awaitable`  **coroutine object**.

```python
import types

def my_gen():
  yield 1
  yield 2

my_coroutine_obj = types.coroutine(my_gen)
```

The new coroutine object is still **iterable**:
```python
for element in my_coroutine_obj:
  print(element)

# 1
# 2
```

In addition, the generator based coroutine is **awaitable**, but does not necessarily implement `__await__()`

---
## Practice

Convert `my_generator` to a coroutine function:
```
import types

def my_generator():
   yield 1

my_coroutine = ???.???(my_generator)
```

* `gen`
* `generator`
* `await`
* `gen_to_co`
