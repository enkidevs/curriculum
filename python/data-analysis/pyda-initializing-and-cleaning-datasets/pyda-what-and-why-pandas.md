# What is pandas and why use it?

---
## Content

`pandas` is an open-source data manipulation tool. It is fast, powerful, and flexible.

It offers an efficient `DataFrame` object used for data manipulation. 

With `DataFrame`s you can import, transform, manipulate, clean, and analyze datasets.

Think of an `DataFrame` as a library with empty shelves. When we import a dataset into the `DataFrame` we fill up the shelves with books(data).

After we fill up our library, we can clean it up and analyze it. 

For instance, we could search through the library, remove the books we don't like, split books into different shelves by organizing them into categories, sort, count, remove duplicates, and more.

`pandas` is built on the numerical python library called `numpy`.

> To be able to use `pandas`, you will have to install `numpy`[1] first. 

Check this footnote to learn how to install `pandas`[2] through `pip` or `conda`.
