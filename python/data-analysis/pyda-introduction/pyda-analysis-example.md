# Analysis Process Example

---
## Content

Now that you know what this topic is about, let's take a look at an example of the data analysis process!

First, we figure out which question we want to answer.

- I want to find which employees have worked for more than 1000 hours.

This means gathering all the workers' information along with dates they have started working on.

- Next, we want to measure hours from the beginning of their employment.

If we have the exact dates the employees started work on, as well as how many hours they put in daily/weekly, we can calculate how many hours they have worked for.

- Then, we have different tools we can use to spot patterns. 

Since this is a relatively simple task, there are no patterns to look at here. As an example of a pattern, you could find the day on which people worked most.

- Analyze/conclude. 

After the analysis, we've found that 6 employees have worked more than 1000 hours.

- Communicate/share findings

After analyzing all employees, these six employees have the most hours put in with Emma having the most.
