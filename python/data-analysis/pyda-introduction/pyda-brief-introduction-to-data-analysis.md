# Intro to Data Analysis With Python

---
## Content

Data analysis is the process of analyzing and discovering useful information from data.

The process has a handful of steps:

- Decide which questions you want to answer
- Figure out which data you need
- Decide how you want to measure and gather your data
- After collecting the data, you can use different tools to spot patterns
- Analyze/conclude your findings
- Communicate/share the findings

> ðŸ’¡ The analysis process is iterative. You will sometimes repeat the same steps to get different or more accurate results based on newly acquired data.

> We will explain why Python was chosen for this course in the next insights.
