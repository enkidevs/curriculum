# Python Data Libraries

---
## Content

Libraries are groups of pre-written code often referred to as *modules*.

You can import the libraries and use their *modules* in your code.

A module is a file with Python code that contains one or more variables, functions, and classes.

For instance, Python comes with a built-in *Standard Library*. This library provides several built-in modules. 

Among them, we have built-in functions, constants, types, exceptions, and so on...

This library is very extensive. Some functions included there are:

| Func Name | Brief Explanation                  | Example                               |
|-----------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `print()` | Used to print a message            | `print("Hello World")`                |
| `dict()`  | Used to create a dictionary        | `x = dict(name = "Stefan", age = 27)` |
| `abs()`   | Get the absolute value of a number | `abs(-5)`                             |

> ðŸ’¡ To view the full list of modules from the *standard library* check out the **Learn more** section. 

Functions from the *standard library* are always available.

The ones that don't fall in the *standard library* category are the community-driven libraries.

Here're some well-known libraries for data analysis which we will use throughout this course:

`matplotlib` is used to create visualizations.

`numpy` makes working with arrays much easier and faster than Python lists.

`pandas` has many useful tools used for data analysis.
