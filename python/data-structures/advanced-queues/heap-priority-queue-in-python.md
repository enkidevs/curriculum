# Heap/Priority Queue in Python

---
## Content

**Python** provides the `heapq` module, an implementation of the heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

The difference between **Python's** implementation and the textbook one is that the former uses `0`-based indexing and the `pop` method returns the smallest element.

Import the module:
```python
import heapq
```

Transform a `list` to a `heap`:
```python
a = [8, 4, 5, 12, 9, 7]
heapq.heapify(a)
 
```

Pop (and return) the smallest item:
```python
print(heapq.heappop(a)) # 4
print(a)
# [5, 8, 7, 12, 9]
```

Replace the smallest element with another:
```python
heapq.heapreplace(a, 999)
print(a)
# [7, 8, 999, 12, 9]
```
