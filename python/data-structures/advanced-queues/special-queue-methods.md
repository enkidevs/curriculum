# Special `queue` methods

---
## Content

All `queue` objects (`Queue` , `LifoQueue` and `PriorityQueue`) provide a plethora of public methods useful in many scenarios.

Imagine we have the sample `Queue` with a limit of 3 elements:
```python
import queue

q = queue.Queue(3)
q.put(1)
q.put(2)
q.put(3)

```

Get the approximate size of the `queue`:
```python
print(q.qsize())
# output: 3

``` 

Check if a `queue` is empty or full:
``` python
print(q.empty())
# output: False
print(q.full())
# output: True

``` 
When you want to `put`  an element in the queue but it's full, you can make the method call block for some number of seconds until there is a free slot:
```python
q.put(4, block=True,timeout=None)

``` 
With `timeout=None` it **blocks** the queue until there is a free slot. If `timeout` is a number it will raise  an `Empty` exception if no free slot was available in that time.

The same syntax and logic applies to the `get()` method too.

## Practice

Check if queue `e` is full:

```
print(e.???()) 
```

* `full` 
* `!space` 
* `max` 
* `complete`

---
## Revision

Declare a queue with a limit of 5 elements:

```
q = ???.???(5)
```

* `queue` 
* `Queue` 
* `new` 
* `instance` 
* `create`
