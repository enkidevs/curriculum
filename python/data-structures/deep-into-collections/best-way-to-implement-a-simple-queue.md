# Best way to implement a simple `queue`

---
## Content

A simple `list` can be easily used and implemented as a **queue** abstract data structure. A queue implies the **first-in, first-out** principle.

However, this approach will prove inefficient because *inserts* and *pops* from the beginning of a list are slow (all elements need shifting by one).

It's recommended to implement **queues** using the `collections.deque` module as it was designed with fast appends and pops from both ends.

```python
from collections import deque
queue = deque(["a", "b", "c"])
queue.append("d")
queue.append("e")
queue.popleft()
queue.popleft()
print(queue)
# output is: deque(['c', 'd', 'e'])
```

A reverse queue can be implemented by opting for `appendleft` instead of `append` and `pop` instead of `popleft`.

---
## Practice

A queue can be implemented by using ???  and ??? for adding items, and by using ??? and ??? for removing items.


* appendleft
* append
* pop
* popleft
* appendright
* popright

## Revision

Complete the code snippet so that the queue reads Enki:

```
from collections import deque
queue = deque(["i", "n", \
              "k", "i"])

queue.???
queue.???
print(queue)
```



* `popleft()`
* `appendleft("e")`
* `pop()`
* `append("e")`
* `pop-left()`
* `append-left("e")`
