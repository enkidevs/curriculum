# Get more with `collections`!

---
## Content

In addition to Python's built-in data structures (such as tuples, dicts, and lists), a library module called `collections` provides data structures with additional features, some of which are specializations of the built-in ones.

Import the module:
```python
import collections
```

Specialized container datatypes are usually `dict` subclasses or wrappers around other classes like lists, tuples, etc.

Notable implementations are :
- the `Counter` class used for counting hashable objects.
-  `defaultdict` class used as a faster implementation of a specialised dictionary.
- `namedtuple` class used for defining a meaning for every position in a tuple, often useful with databases or CSV files.
