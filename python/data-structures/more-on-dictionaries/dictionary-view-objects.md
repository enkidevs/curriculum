# `Dictionary` view objects

---
## Content

Dictionaries provide the following methods:
```python
dict.keys() 
# returns a new view of dictionary's keys
dict.values()
# returns a new view of dictionary's values
dict.items()
# returns a new view of dictionary's items
# items are (key, value) pairs
```

Being **view objects**, they are tied dynamically to the dictionary's entries. When the dictionary is changed, the changes are visible in the view.

The `len(dictview)` method will return the number of entries in the dictionary:
```python
>>> a = {'one':1, 'two':2}
>>> keys = a.keys()
>>> len(keys)
2
```
Dictionary's `iter()` method works on dictionary views, returning an iterator over keys, values or items:
```python
iter(keys) 
# iterator over keys is returned 
```
In the same fashion, `in` keyword for testing collection membership, can be used both on dictionaries and dictionary views:
```python
>>> 'one' in keys
True
>>> 'three' in keys
False

```

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to return the number of entries in the dictionary: 

```
>>> d = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3} 
>>> ???(???) 
```


* `len` 
* `d` 
* `entries` 
* `length` 
* `size` 
* `keys`

## Revision

Which keyword is used for testing collection memberships?

```
d = {'python':1} 
Enki = d.keys() 
'python' ??? Enki
```


* `in` 
* `has` 
* `holds` 
* `consists` 
* `belongs`
