  uses incorrect terms - OrderedDict is not a subclass of collections module but
  a class in that module. And it is a subclass of dict.

# Keep things in order with `OrderedDict`

## Content

Another class of the `collections` module is the `OrderedDict`, a subclass of `dict`. This class works just like the normal dictionary, but it remembers the order in which elements are added to it.

Import `OrderedDict`:
```python
from collections import OrderedDict
```
While iteration over a regular `dict` produces the values in arbitrary order,
```python
a = dict()
a['e'] = 'E'
a['n'] = 'N'
a['k'] = 'K'
a['i'] = 'I'
for k, v in a.items():
    print(k, v)
# i I / e E / k K / n N

```
the `OrderedDict` will keep track of the order:
```python
b = OrderedDict()
b['e'] = 'E'
b['n'] = 'N'
b['k'] = 'K'
b['i'] = 'I'
for k, v in b.items():
    print(k, v)
# e E / n N / k K / i I

```

**Equality checks** between two ordered dictionaries are **order-sensitive**.

## Practice

In what order would an iteration over a regular dict produce its values? ???


* Arbitrary
* Ordered
* Ascending
* Descending

---
## Revision

Complete the code snippet to get the below output:

```python
e = ???()  
e['e'] = 'E' 
e['n'] = 'N' 
e['k'] = 'K' 
e['i'] = 'I' 
for k, v in e.???(): 
    print(k, v) 

# e E / n N / k K / i I 
```

* `OrderedDict` 
* `items` 
* `dict` 
* `print` 
* `odict` 
* `dictionary` 
* `holds`
