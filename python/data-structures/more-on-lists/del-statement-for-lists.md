# `del` statement for  lists

---
## Content

Python's `del` statement has multiple usages when used on `lists`.
It differs from the `pop()` method because when using `del`, the element won't be returned when removing it. 

Delete the *element* at a given *index*:
```python
>>> a = [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
>>> del a[0]
>>> a
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

Delete a *slice* of the *list*:
```python
>>> a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
>>> del a[0:2]
>>> a
[ 3, 4 ]
```
Note that even though three elements are specified (*0,1,2*), the last one is not deleted. Consider this example, in which nothing happens:
```python
>>> a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
>>> del a[0:0]
>>> a
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```
To delete the entire *list*:
```python
>>> del a[:]
>>> a
[]
```

## Practice

Whatâ€™s the output of the following code snippet:

```
>>> e = [7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 19]
>>> del e[2:4]
>>> e
???
```

* `[7, 8, 15, 19]`
* `[7, 8, 19]`
* `[]`
* `[7, 11, 15, 19]`
* `[7, 15, 19]`
