# Keep large lists sorted with `bisect`

---
## Content

Using the basic **bisection algorithm**, Python's `bisect` module provides a more efficient way of inserting elements into a list while keeping it **sorted**.

Import the module:
```python
import bisect
```

Suppose we have the list:
```python
a = [3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30]

```

We can now add elements with the `insort` method which will put the new element to the left of any existing equal elements in the list:
```python
bisect.insort(a, 8)
bisect.insort(a, 9)
bisect.insort(a, 35)

```
Now to see the result:
```python
print(a)
# [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 35]

```

To find the **insertion point** of an element without inserting it use `bisect`, in case if there are identical elements in the list it returns the position after them i.e. the right most position:
```python
print(bisect.bisect(a, 11))
# 7
```

## Practice

Consider the following:
```
a = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
```
What will the output of `print(bisect.bisect(a, 2))` be? ???


* 5
* 2
* 4

## Revision

`bisect` provides two useful methods:
 - `insort`: ???
 - `bisect`: ???


* inserts a new element into an ordered list
* returns the position where to insert a new element in a sorted list
* sorts and returns an unsorted list
