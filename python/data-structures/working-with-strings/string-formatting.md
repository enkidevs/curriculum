# String Formatting

---
## Content

Python uses string formatting in a similar way to the language C to create new and formatted strings.

The `%` operator formats a set of variables enclosed in a tuple, which is a fixed size list, alongside a format string which holds normal text with special symbols such as `%s` and `%d`, these are known as *argument specifiers*.

These are the argument specifiers:
- `%s` is for a String
- `%d` is for Integers
- `%f` is for Floats

For instance, say you have a variable with a string inside it, this is how you print that string:

```python
app = 'Enki'
print('Learning Python with %s' % app)
# Learning Python with Enki
```

To use two or more argument specifiers you must use a tuple:
```python
app = 'Enki'
streak = 3

print('''This is Python workout number %d
       with %s''' % (app, streak))
```

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to print the variable `str` to the console:
```python
str = 'practice'
print('The best way to learn is to ???'
        ??? str)
```

* `%s`
* `%`
* `%d`
* `%f`
* `+`
* `/`
