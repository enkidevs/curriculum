# Nested lists comprehension

---
## Content

Since a list comprehension can take any **expression** as its initial expression, it's possible to include another list comprehension at that position, resulting in  a **nested** list comprehension.  

These are often useful, but are often used to work with matrices.
```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], \
[7, 8, 9]]

```

Say we want to create another matrix with values equal to the squares of each element in the original matrix:
```python
matrix2 = [[x**2 for x in row] for \
row in matrix]
#matrix2 = [[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36],\
# [49, 64, 81]]
```

A more advanced list comprehension with two for clauses and two if clauses:
```python
lc = [ (x, y) for x in \
range(10) if x % 2 == 0 \
for y in range(20) if \
y % 3 == 0 ]
# lc
# [(0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 6), \
# (0, 9), (0, 12), (0, 15), (0, 18),\
# (2, 0), (2, 3), (2,6), (2, 9), \
# (2, 12), (2, 15), (2, 18), (4, 0), \
# (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 12), \
# (4, 15), (4, 18), (6, 0), (6, 3), \
# (6, 6), (6, 9), (6, 12), (6, 15), \
# (6, 18), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), \
# (8, 9), (8, 12), (8, 15), (8, 18)]

```
