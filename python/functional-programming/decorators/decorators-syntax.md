# Decorators syntax

---
## Content

Now that you are familiar with the concept of decorators, we can talk about ways you'll see them in practice. With regard to syntax, Python specific decorator's symbol is `@`. Looking at the previous example:  
```python
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
def h2_decorate(string_function):
  def func_wrapper(name):
    return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
      .format(string_function(name))
  return func_wrapper
hello_wrapper = h2_decorate(say_hello)
```
We can shorten the code and get rid of the variable assignment by introducing the `@` notation:
```python
def h2_decorate(string_function):
  def func_wrapper(name):
    return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
      .format(string_function(name))
  return func_wrapper

@h2_decorate
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)

print(say_hello("Mike"))
# <h2>Hello, Mike!<h2>
```
As you can see, the function is decorated, without the need of an explicit `h2_decorate` binding. This shorthand notation is also useful in case of multiple decorators being used (`div_decorate` wraps a string in `div` tags):
```python
# variable assignment
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
long_wrap =
  div_decorate(h2_decorate(say_hello))
print(long_wrap("Mike"))

# @ notation
@div_decorate
@h2_decorate
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
print(say_hello("Mike"))
```
Both approaches will result in:
```HTML
<div><h2>Hello, Mike!</h2></div>
```
### Passing arguments

In our case, all the decorators do is wrap a string in tags. This example is simple and straightforward and this might not always be the case. As the outcome is similar for both our decorators (*div* and *h2*), we can take advantage of another feature: passing arguments to the decorator function through `@` notation.

However, this syntax requires an additional enclosing function, as the **decorator** itself should only receive the function to be decorated as its sole parameter:
```python
def tags_wrapper(tag):
  def func_decorator(string_function):
    def name_wrapper(name):
      return "<{0}>{1}</{0}>"
        .format(tag, string_function(name))
    return name_wrapper
  return func_decorator

@tags_wrapper("div")
@tags_wrapper("h2")
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
print(say_hello("Mike"))
# <div><h2>Hello, Mike!</h2><div>

@tags_wrapper("h2")
@tags_wrapper("em")
def say_goodbye(name):
  return "Goodbye, {0}!".format(name)
print(say_goodbye("Mike"))
# <h2><em>Goodbye, Mike!<em></h2>
```

## Practice

Which of the following is `not` a potential valid way of decorating the function `foo`?
```python
# A
foo = decorator(foo)
# B
@decorator
def foo():
  ...
# C
def decorator():
  def foo():
    ...
# D
@decorator(param)
def foo():
  ...


```
???

* C
* D
* A
* B
* they are all valid
