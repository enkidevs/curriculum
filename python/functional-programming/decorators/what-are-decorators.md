# What Are Decorators?

---
## Content

**Decorators**, or function decorators, are *wrappers* to existing functions, built using the concept of *higher-order functions* (closures).
   
You've got this generic function:
```python
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
```
Say you need to wrap the output of the function in *heading tags*, like this:
```html
<h2>Hello, Mike!</h2>
```
You could always define another function that makes use of `say_hello`:
```python
def hello_heading(name):
  return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
    .format(say_hello(name))
```
Which is perfectly acceptable, but you'd be giving away the opportunity of making your code extensible. What if you are going to need a `say_goodbye` function, formatted in the same way? You'd have to create two more functions:
```python
def say_goodbye(name):
  return "Goodbye, {0}!".format(name)
def goodbye_heading(name):
  return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
    .format(say_goodbye(name))
```
This is not ideal, since all you had done, for both function, was to **decorate** (enhance, manipulate or extend) their output. What if could write a function that wraps any function's output in `<h2>` tags?
```python
def h2_decorate(string_function):
  def func_wrapper(name):
    return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
      .format(string_function(name))
  return func_wrapper
```
There you have it! Your decorator returns a new function that wouldn't care about the underlying structure of the passed function - it would just wrap everything up:
```python
hello_wrapper = h2_decorate(say_hello)
goodbye_wrapper = h2_decorate(say_goodbye)
print(hello_wrapper("Mike"))
print(goodbye_wrapper("Sam"))
# <h2>Hello, Mike!</h2>
# <h2>Goodbye, Sam!</h2>
```
We've mentioned *higher-order functions* in the introduction. Try and figure out where the concept is used in `h2_decorate`'s function definition.

If you couldn't figure it out, consider that `h2_decorate`'s references to the `say_hello` and `say_goodbye` are still in scope when you call the wrapper functions (`hello_wrapper` and `goodbye_wrapper`, respectively): the time capsule worked.

## Practice

The number of similar looking functions that can be decorated using the same decorator is

???


* as many as needed
* one
* two
* none

## Revision

Which of the following examples represent a decorator?
```python
def say_hello(name):
  return "Hello, {0}!".format(name)
# A
def hello_heading(name):
  return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
    .format(say_hello(name))
# B
def hello_heading(func):
  def func_wrapper(name):
    return "<h2>{0}</h2>"
      .format(func(name))
  return func_wrapper
```
???

* B
* A
* both
* neither
