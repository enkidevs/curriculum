# Benefits of using generators

---
## Content

Generators are functions which behave like iterators, but can have better performance characteristics. These include:   

* Creating values on demand, resulting in lower memory consumption.

* The values returned are lazily generated. Hence, it is not necessary to wait until all the values in a list are generated before using them.

However, the set of generated values can only be used once.

---
## Revision

Because generators create values on demand, this results in ??? memory consumption.


* lower
* higher
