# yield() and next()

---
## Content

As we already know, **generators** are a way of creating iterable items in **Python**. The behaviour of a generator is mainly defined by the `yield()` and `next()` methods.
 
When the **python interpreter** finds the `next()` function called on a generator, it jumps to the generator's body and executes every expression until it encounters the next `yield()`.

The `yield()` **evaluates** and **returns** the value of the expression that follows. **Python** does two interesting actions at this stage:
- it keeps track of the position of the next `yield()`
- it stores the state of the **local variables** until the next call

**N.B** if all `yield()`s were evaluated and we encounter an extra call of the `next()` method, the following exception will be returned:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

Consider the following generator:
```
def range_gen(n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        yield i
        i += 1
```

This **function** generates all natural numbers up to `n`. Let's use the `next()` method now:
```
>>> gen = range_gen(3)
>>> print(next(gen))
0
>>> print(next(gen))
1
>>> print(next(gen))
2
>>> print(next(gen))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

## Practice

What is the output of the following snippet?
```
def countdown(num):
    while num > 0:
        yield num
        num -= 1

>>> gen = countdown(5)
>>> print(next(gen))

```
???


* `5`
* `0`
* `1`

## Revision

Consider the following snippet:
```
def double(L):
  for x in ???:
    ??? x*2

my_gen = double([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(???(my_gen))
print(next???)
```

Suppose we want to print the doubled value for the first 2 numbers in the list. Fill the gaps accordingly.



* `L`
* `yield`
* `next`
* `(my_gen)`
* `my_gen`
* `next()`
* `yield()`
* `T`
