# chain(), filterfalse() and compress()


---

## Content

The `itertools` module provides a host of useful methods for working with iterable objects. Out of these methods, one can distinguish the iterators which terminate on the shortest input sequence, such as `chain()`, `filterfalse()` and `compress()`

Let's start with `chain()`. This method allows us to "glue" the end of one sequence to the start of another, chaining them together. This can be done for multiple sequences at a time. Take a look at this example:

```python
import itertools;

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(
  list(
    itertools.chain(letters, numbers)))

# Result = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Next, `filterfalse` iterates through a collection of elements, and, given a boolean expression to evaluate with the each element, returns a collection which only contains the elements where the expression evaluated to false.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

print(
  list(
    itertools.filterfalse(
      lambda x: 2 < x < 7, numbers)))

# Result = [1, 2, 7, 8]
```

Finally, `compress()`, which takes two collections, a and b, and returns only the elements in a where the corresponding element in b evaluates to true.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
boolean = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

print(
  list(
    itertools.compress(numbers, boolean)))

# Result: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

## Practice

Let's say we have three lists. The first is a list of prices for items on an online shop. The second is a list of proposed discounts, to be subtracted from those prices. Finally, the third list is a list of booleans which indicate which products (assume one product per index) are included in the sale.

Complete the code below to print a list of the original prices and a list of those same prices with the discount applied.

```python
import itertools;

prices = [120, 300, 90, 200, 60]
discounts = [-30, -100, -35, -85, -15]
isInSale = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
salePrices = []

discountIterator =
iter(
  itertools.???(
    discounts, isInSale))

fullPricesInSale =
itertools.compress(prices, isInSale)

def f(x):
  price = x + next(discountIterator)
  salePrices.append(price)
  return(price <= 0)

print(
  list(
    itertools.???(
      lambda x: f(x), fullPricesInSale)))

print(
  list(salePrices))
```

## Revision

What is the result of the following code execution?

```python
import itertools;

names = ['Tom', 'Sadiq', 'Lars',
          'Lee', 'Jean']
boolean = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

print(
  list(
    itertools.islice(
      itertools.cycle(
        itertools.compress(
          names, boolean)), 0, 6)))
```

???

- `['Tom', 'Lars', 'Lee', 'Tom', 'Lars', 'Lee']`
- `['Tom', 'Sadiq', 'Lars', 'Lee', 'Jean', 'Tom']`
- `['Sadiq', 'Jean', 'Sadiq', 'Jean', 'Sadiq', 'Jean']`
- `<itertools.islice object at 0x????????>`
