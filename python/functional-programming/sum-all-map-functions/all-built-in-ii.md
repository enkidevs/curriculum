# Truthiness


---

## Content

Woah! Why are `1` and `abc` evaluated as `True`:

```python
print(all([1, 'abc', True]))
# result = True
print(all([" ", 'abc']))
# Result = True
print(all(["", 'abc']))
# Result = False
```

This is called *truthiness*[1] in Python. Each type has specific rules regarding what boolean value it evaluate as. 

For example:
- non-zero numbers and non-empty strings will evaluate as `True`. 
- `0` and `""` will evaluate as `False`.

## Footnotes

[1:Python Truthiness]
Using the `bool` built-in function, we can check the truthiness of any object in Python. The truthiness rules can be examined at length in the Learn More section.
