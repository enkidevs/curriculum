# The all Function


---

## Content

The `all` built-in function takes an iterable object and returns `True` if all the elements in the iterable object evaluate to `True`.

In practice, `all` checks if `bool(element) == True` for each element in the iterable object.

Take for example:

```python
print(all([True, True, False]))
#result = False
```
