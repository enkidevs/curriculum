  Using the word Enki or enki in many places such as for class name, instance
  name, return value (as in this example), is confusing to readers. Use
  different and more relevant names to distinguish. --> updated.


  Also, what is the purpose of showing that you can do:


  ef = enki.f


  and then call:


  ef()


  ?


  It should be connected to some purpose or benefit, otherwise may be better not
  to show it.

# Method objects


---

## Content

Methods are seen as functions called on *objects* -- and there is a clear distinction between a **method call** and a **method object**.

Considering the following class and its instantiation:

```python
class Enki:
  def f(self):
    return "Python"

enki = Enki()

```

**Calling** a method is straightforward:

```python
enki.f() # this will return 'Python'
print(enki.f()) # prints 'Python'
```

However, you are allowed to store the method body in another variable, without having to call the method right away:

```python
ef = enki.f # note the lack of parenthesis
ef() # returns 'Python'
print(ef()) # prints 'Python'
```

> üí° Under the hood, `enki.f()` is **exactly equivalent** to `Enki.f(enki)`:

```python
enki.f() # this will return 'Python'
print(enki.f()) # prints 'Python'

Enki.f(enki) # also returns 'Python'
print(Enki.f(enki)) # also prints 'Python'
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `enki.f(anything)` will throw an error because `enki.f()` only takes the Enki class `self` as a parameter.

```python
enki.f('foobar')

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#  File "main.py", line 6, in <module>
#    enki.f('foobar')
# TypeError: f() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

## Practice

Store a method object of class `Hello` in the variable `temp` and call it afterwards:

```python
class Hello:
  def greet(name):
    print('Hello ' + name + '!')

temp = ???
???    # Hello Enki!
```

- Hello.greet
- temp('Enki')
- temp.greet()
- Hello('Enki')
- Hello.greet()

## Revision

Store in variable `x` a method object from the `Test` class:

```python
class Test:
  def p(self):
    return "p method"
??? = Test()
x = test.???
```

- `test`
- `p`
- `p()`
- `Test`
- `new`
- `def`
- `get`
