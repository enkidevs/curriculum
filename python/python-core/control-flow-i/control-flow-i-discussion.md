Now that you learned some Python, it's time to apply it!

How would you write a *notifier* program? It should print a message on a certain day of the week.

It's up to you to choose the day of the week and the message that is printed.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

When you're ready, leave a comment here with your submission. If you don't want to participate, you can always check the comment section to see what the other users come up with.

> 💡 The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit, the implementation is up to you.

[1: Hints]

Start by creating a variable that stores your day. 

Then, using a condition (`if`), check that the day is the one you want to print the message on.

Finally, print the message.
