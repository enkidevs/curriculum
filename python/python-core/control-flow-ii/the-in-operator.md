# The in operator


---

## Content

Python's `in` operator is an example of a *membership operator*[1]. 

It can be used to check whether a value exists *inside another object*.

It evaluates to `True` if it finds the specified value, and `False` if it doesn't.

Here's an example of the `in` operator searching for a string pattern inside a longer string:

```python
string = 'Python'
sentence = "Python's the best language to learn!"

if string in sentence:
  print('I agree!')
else:
  print('Hmm, not sure I agree.')

# I agree!
```

When the `in` keyword is used on a string, Python will check for any sequence of matching substrings.

## Practice

Complete the following code snippet to print `True` if `letter` is in `my_string`, and `False` otherwise:

```python
letter = 'p'
my_string = 'stop, collaborate and listen'

if letter ??? my_string:
  print(???)
else:
  print(???)
```

- `in`
- `True`
- `False`
- `is`
- `find`

## Revision

The `in` operator evaluates to ??? if it finds the specified value in the ???.

- `True`
- sequence
- `true`
- `false`
