## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a function that will:
> - **check if a number is between 0-6**
> - **if it is, output the corresponding day of the week (0 for Monday)** 
> - **if not, output a message like "Try Again."**

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def something(x):`)
- flow control (`if (x > 1):`)
- dictionary mapping (`week = {1: "Monday"...}`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

One way to solve this is by using dictionary mapping.

Create a function with an input argument.

Add all possible arguments for a week as key value pairs to a dictionary. Also add a default argument in case the input is not within the dictionary.

Then call the function with a number argument.
