## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **determines if a number is even or odd and outputs a message**.

Sample input and output:
```plain-text
# Input:
# 314

# Output:
# It is even
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, %, ...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

[1: Hints]

Use a flow control statement to check and `print` if the number is even or odd.
