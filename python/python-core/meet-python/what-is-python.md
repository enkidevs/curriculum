# Python Intro

## Content


Python is the world's fastest-growing programming language.

It's designed to be easy to read, using English keywords and simple syntax[1].

For example, here's how you might check whether a number is greater than another number:

```python
my_age = 23
legal_age = 21
if my_age >= legal_age:
  print("You can have a beer!")
else:
  print("Unlucky.")
```


Python is also a *general-purpose* programming language. That means it can be used for *just about anything*. 

You can use it to build websites, web apps and desktop apps. But it's also used in scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis!

## Practice

Let's write some Python code! Do you remember how to print a message?

> Don't worry; this is to get you comfortable with code. 
> You'll learn all about how this works in the upcoming lessons.

```python
my_age = 20
legal_age = 18
if my_age >= legal_age:
  ???("Enjoy the ride!")
```

## Footnotes

[1:Syntax]
The syntax of a programming language sets the rules on how a language can be written and understood by the computer.

The same idea exists in human languages. 

The English language has unique types of words like *verb* and *nouns* and rules on which should come first to make a correct sentence; Python has a different set of rules on making valid Python statements.
