## Footnotes

[1:Syntax]
The syntax of a programming language sets the rules on how a language can be written and understood by the computer.

The same idea exists in human languages. 

The English language has unique types of words like *verb* and *nouns* and rules on which should come first to make a correct sentence; Python has a different set of rules on making valid Python statements.
