# Python Intro

## Content

Python is a popular *high-level* programming language.

That means it's designed to be easy to read, using English keywords and simple syntax[1].

For example, here's how you might check whether a number is greater than another number:

```python
my_age = 23
legal_age = 21
if my_age >= legal_age:
    print("You can have a beer!")
else:
    print("Unlucky.")
```

Python is also a *general-purpose* programming language. That means it can be used for *just about anything*. 

You can use it to build websites, web apps and desktop apps. But it's also used in scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis!

## Footnotes

[1:Syntax]
The syntax is the set of rules that define how a program will be written and interpreted. It covers the symbols, indentation and keywords of the language. All programming languages use different syntax.
