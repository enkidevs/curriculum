## Content

Python is seen as the number one language to learn. Here are a few reasons why:

1. It's **simple to read and understand**

This makes it an *ideal language for beginners to learn*. And it acts as a stepping-stone for learning other object-oriented [1] languages.

Python is also concise.

For the same task, Python requires *3-5* times less code than Java, and up to *10* times less code than C++.

2. It's a **powerful language for data science**

Python is the preferred language for Data Science and Machine Learning. Both areas with exciting work and a growing demand for jobs.

3. A huge community of **web developers** use it

Its popularity for web development means that there are numerous *open source libraries*, *frameworks* and *sources of help* for beginners. 

You can use Python to build whatever you want to build, from a scraper to an e-commerce site.

## Footnotes

[1:Object-oriented programming]
All you need to know for now is that **object-oriented programming** (OOP) is a *programming pattern* that works with real-life entities. These entities are called **objects**, and they have *attributes* and *behaviors*. 

Let's use the common car analogy to better understand OOP. 

Think of the car as the object. The model, color or age of the car are the object's *attributes*. Whether the engine is on, or whether it's moving are *behaviors* and would exist as functions.
