# Using Lists as Queues


---

## Content

A common exercise in Computer Science is implementing advanced data structures using the primitive ones. In this insight we'll create a **new class** that implements a **queue** data structure using **lists**.

**Queues** are abstract data structures that follow the principle of **first in, first out** (FIFO) when adding or removing an element.

The addition of elements is called **enqueue** and every new element is inserted at the back of the queue. The opposite action is called **dequeue** and it returns the first element from the queue.

Let's define a **queue** class now:

```py
class Queue:
  def __init__(self):
    self.items = []

  def isEmpty(self):
    return self.items == []

  def enqueue(self, item):
    self.items.insert(0,item)

  def dequeue(self):
    return self.items.pop()

  def size(self):
    return len(self.items)
```

> 💡 Instead of `size`  you can use `__len__`. It will allow you to use `len(myQueue)` instead of `myQueue.size()`. Check the *Learn More* section for a playground link. We've prepared both queue classes in there so you can test them out and decide which one you want to use.

As you can see, we defined 5 **methods**:

- the **constructor**, which creates a **new empty list**
- a method that checks whether the **queue is empty**
- a method `enqueue`, which adds an element to the **back of the queue**
- a method `dequeue`, which removes an element from the **front of the queue**
- a method `size`, which returns the size of the **queue**

> 💡 If you plan on using this code in production, you shouldn't create your own queue class. There are better alternatives out there such as the [`queue` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#module-queue).

## Practice

Using the `Queue` module we defined before. We want to print out the `2017` number. Fill the gaps accordingly:

```py
import __

my_queue = Queue()

my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)
my_queue.enqueue(__)

for n in __.items:
    print(n)
```

???

- Queue, 7, 1, 0, 2, my_queue
- queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue
- Queue, 2, 0, 1, 7, my_queue


---

## Revision

What will the output generated by the following snippet look like?

```py
import Queue

temp = Queue()

temp.enqueue('Q')
temp.enqueue('U')
temp.enqueue('E')
temp.enqueue('U')
temp.enqueue('E')

print(temp.size())

for n in temp.items:
    print(n)
```

???

- 5 E U E U Q
- 5 Q U E U E
- Q U E U E
- E U E U Q
