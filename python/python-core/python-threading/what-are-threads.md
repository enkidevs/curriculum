# What are Threads?

---

## Content

In computing, there are `processes` and `threads`.

A `process` is an instance of a program being executed. They have an assigned memory space that holds instructions for running the program. They may also have additional data stored required for execution.

`Threads` are separate sequential flows of control within a program. They are more lightweight than `processes`.

They are components of a `process`. A single `process` can have one or multiple `threads`.

All `threads` within a `process` share the same memory space (the memory space of their parent `process`.)

Along side the memory that is being shared, any code, including variables is shared between them.
