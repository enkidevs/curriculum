## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using the two `lists` below, your task is to:
> - **remove the last value from the smallerNumbers list**
> - **add the biggerNumbers list to the smaller one**
> - **output the new list**

Use these lists:
```python
smallerNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
biggerNumbers = [7, 9, 11]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- built-in methods (`extend()`, `remove()`, `pop()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You have to pop a value from the smaller `list` and then add the bigger `list` to the smaller one using a built-in method.
