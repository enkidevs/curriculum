# Variables


---

## Content

Python uses variables to store data in memory. Think of variables as *containers that hold data* which can be changed later in the program.

For example:

```python
number = 10
number = 100
```

Initially, the value of `number` was `10`. Later it was changed to `100`.

```python
print(number)
# 100
```

Python is a case-sensitive language and variable names should use [snake case](https://enki.com/glossary/general/snakecase), like so:

```python
this_is_a_long_variable_name
```

> Always give variables a name that makes sense. 

While `c = 10` is valid, writing `count = 10` would make more sense. It is easier to figure out what the variable represents when you revisit your code and for other programmers on your team.
