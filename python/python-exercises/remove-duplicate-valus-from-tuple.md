## Content

Given a tuple with repeating words, can you define a function that will take a tuple as input, remove the duplicates, and output the result?


Tuple:
```python
myTuple = ("Stefan", "Mark", "Joane","Steven", "Natasha", "Mark", "Steven", "Mark", "Natasha")
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function definition (`def ...:`)
- loops (`for...in...:`)
- flow control (`if(x > 1)`)

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

When you're ready, open the playground and write your code. When you're finished, press the submit button and your code will become a comment on the question. This way, everyone can review your code and you can review everyone else's to see other people's approach to solving this question.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def duplicateRemoval(t):
```

Inside the function first convert the input tuple into a list. (`list(variable)`)

Then initate a `for...in` loop to cycle through every word.

Insie the loop, add an `if` to check the count of every word (you can use the built-in `.count()`).

If the count is greater than or equal to `2`, use the `.remove()` method to remove the duplicate.

Finally convert the `list` back to a `tuple` using `tuple(variable)` and return the result.

Outside of the function, call the function with the provided `myTuple`.
