    # Welcome to the Python coding playground
    # You're a meteorologist analyzing this week's temperature data!

    import numpy as np

    # Last week's temperatures (°C)
    last_week = np.array([20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 21, 20])

    # 2. Calculate average
    average = ...  # Finish this line

    # 3. Find temperature extremes
    hottest = ...  # Finish this line
    coldest = ...  # Finish this line

    # 4. Compare weeks
    temp_difference = ...  # Finish this line

    # Extra challenges
    # 1. Find temperature range (max - min)
    # 2. Calculate day-by-day differences
    # 3. Find days above average

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to analyze temperature data for a local weather station!

To solve this, try using:

- `np.array()` to store temperatures
- `np.mean()` to find average temperature
- `np.max()` and `np.min()` for extremes
- Comparison operators for analysis
- Statistical methods for averages

Give it a try, and feel free to experiment!

> 💡 Hint: Use array operations to compare entire weeks at once!

If you're stuck, try testing each calculation separately and printing results to
check your work.

> Extra challenges: 🚀
>
> - Find temperature range (max - min)
> - Calculate day-by-day differences
> - Find days above average
> - Plot temperatures as a line graph
> - Calculate weekly temperature variance
