## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **create a function that joins two lists and sorts the resulting list in ascending order.**

Sample lists to use:
```python
oddNumbers = [101, 23, 11, 37, 3, 83, 1]
evenNumbers = [12, 0, 8, 92, 98, 44, 76]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- order (`sorted`, `reversed`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
- built-in function (`.append()`)
- list concatenation (`list1 + list2`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You can use list concatenation and the `sorted` method or a `for` loop.
