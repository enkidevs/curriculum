> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **adds or subtracts two numbers and outputs the result**.

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+ or -`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two variables to hold your numbers. You can calculate and `print` the result on the same line.
