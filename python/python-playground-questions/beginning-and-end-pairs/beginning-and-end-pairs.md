> 👩‍💻 Using the `numbers` list, your task is to write a program that **print the first and last, second and second to last, and so on**.

Sample list:
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```

Sample output:
```python
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
[5, 6]
[7, 8]
[9, 10]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`while..`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You only need to loop through half of the list.

To get the values in each loop cycle, take the loop counter index from the left and right sides of the list.

For eample, the third element from left and right of `newList` is:

Which looks like this:
```python
newList = [lst[3], lst[-(3+1)]]
```
