## Content

Given the list:

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
```

Can you write a program that will print the first and last, second and second to last, and so on?

The output should look like this:
```python
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
[5, 6]
[7, 8]
[9, 10]
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`while..`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You only need to loop through half of the list.

To get the values in each loop cycle, take the loop counter index from the left and right sides of the list.

For eample, the 3rd element from left and right of newList is:

Which looks like this:
```python
newList = [lst[3], lst[-(3+1)]]
```
