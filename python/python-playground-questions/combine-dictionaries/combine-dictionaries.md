# Combine Dictionaries

## Content

Can you create a function that will take two dictionaries as input, combine them, and return a single dictionary?

> Don't forget to call the function afterward.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 33`).
- function declaration (`def...:`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining your function with your choice of name. It should take two dictionaries as input.

One way to add is by using `.update()` within the function and returning the resulting dictionary.

Outside of the function create the two dictionaries and call your function within a `print` statement.
