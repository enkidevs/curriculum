## Content

Can you write a program that will take a number as input and output its factorial value?

> A factorial of the number 5, which is written as `5!`, would be calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

Example output:

```plain-text
5! is equal to 120
```

For the sake of learning, try not to use the built-in `math` modules' `factorial()` method.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 18...`)
- flow control (`for...in`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two variables; one for the inputted number and the other to start from `1` and hold the final number.

One will store the inputted number and the other will start from 1 and store the final number.

Next, create a `for...in` loop for the range of `1` to `number + 1`.

Inside the loop multiply the second variable by each number in the range and save it in the same variable.

Example print:
```python
print ("The factorial of {0} is {1} ".format(number,factorial))
```
Output:
```plain-text
The factorial of 5 is 120 
```
