## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **calculates and outputs the factorial of a number**.

> A factorial of the number 5, written as `5!`, would be calculated as 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.

Example output:

```plain-text
5! is equal to 120
```

For the sake of learning, try not to use the built-in `math` modules' `factorial()` method.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 18...`)
- flow control (`for...in`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating two variables, for example, `number` and `result`.

One will store the inputted number, and the other will start from 1 and store the final number.

With a `for...in` loop, you can range from the first to the last number.

Inside the loop, multiply the `result` by each number in the loop.

Example print:
```python
print ("The factorial of {0} is {1} ".format(number,factorial))
```
Output:
```plain-text
The factorial of 5 is 120 
```
