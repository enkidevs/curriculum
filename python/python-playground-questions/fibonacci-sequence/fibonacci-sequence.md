# The Fibonacci Sequence

---

## Content

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

Can you write a program that will print the Fibonacci sequence up to 15 terms?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- first two terms of the sequence are `0` and `1`.
- flow control (`while..`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

For this problem you will need two variables to hold your numbers, a counter variable, and a temporary variable.

The temporary variable goes inside the loop while the counter increases at the end of every loop cycle.
