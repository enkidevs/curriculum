# Happy Birthday

## Content

Using the `datetime` and/or `time` modules, create a program that will check if the current date is your birthday. If it is, print a happy birthday message. If it is not, output how many days left till your birthday.

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- importing (`import`, `from...import...`)
- built-in methods(`now()`,`year()`,`month()`,...)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You will need two dates; one for today and another for your birthday.

Use a conditional statement to create two outputs. For days left until your birthday, subtract today's date from your birthday within the `abs()` method to get a positive number as the result.
