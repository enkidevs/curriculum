## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using the `datetime` or `time` modules, your task is to define a `happyBirthday` function. It should:
> - **check if the current date is your birthday**
> - **If it is, print a happy birthday message**
> - **If not, output how many days until your birthday**

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- importing (`import`, `from...import...`)
- built-in methods(`now()`, `year()`, `month()`,...)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You will need two dates; one for today and another for your birthday.

Use a conditional statement to create two outputs. For days left until your birthday, subtract today's date from your birthday within the `abs()` method to get a positive number as the result.
