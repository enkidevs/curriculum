# Harmonic Series

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a function that will **sum up the first 15 terms of the harmonic series and round them to 5 decimal places**.

> The harmonic series is the divergent infinite series that looks like this:

![harmonic-series](https://img.enkipro.com/86e08401cab9a7841c91077c24e46945.png)

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 25`)
- built-in (`range()`, `round()`)
- flow control (`for...in`)
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining a function with a name of your choosing. The function should take a number as input.

> The number will be the number of terms of the divergent series.

The function should use a loop to cycle through, calculate the series, and return the result.

Finally, outside the function, round and return the result up to 5 decimal places.
