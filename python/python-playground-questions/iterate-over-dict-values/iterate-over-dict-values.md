## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that **iterates over each element of a dictionary and prints them**

You can use this dictionary:
```python
myDict = {
  'name': 'Alan', 
  'surname': 'Turing', 
  'education': 'Sherborne School', 
  'country': 'England'
}
```


To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation `person ={'name':'Stefan','age'...}`
- flow control (`for...in`)
- built-in methods(`.items()`, `get()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create the dictionary and use a loop to go through each key-value pair.

Example:
```python
for x, y in dictionary.items():
  # ...
```
