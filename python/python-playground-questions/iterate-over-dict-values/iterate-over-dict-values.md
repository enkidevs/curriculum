## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that: 
> - **iterates over each element of a dictionary and prints them**

You can use this dictionary:
```python
myDict = {
  'name': 'Alan', 
  'surname': 'Turing', 
  'education': 'Sherborne School', 
  'country': 'England'
}
```


To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation `person ={'name':'Stefan','age'...}`
- flow control (`for...in`)
- built-in methods(`.items()`, `get()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create the dictionary and use a loop to go through each key-value pair.

Example:
```python
for x, y in dictionary.items():
  # ...
```
