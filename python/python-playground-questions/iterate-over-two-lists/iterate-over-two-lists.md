    # 👋 Welcome to the Python coding playground. 
    # Lists to use:

    name = ['Stefan', 'Michael', 'Rebekah', "Natasha"]
    lastName = ['Stojanovic', 'Stevens', 'Mikaelson', "Romanoff"]

# Iterate Over two Lists

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that: **simultaneously iterates over two lists and prints a value from each list as a pair**

Sample arrays:

```javascript
let names = ['Stefan', 'Michael', 'Rebekah', "Natasha"];
let lastNames = ['Stojanovic', 'Stevens', 'Mikaelson', "Romanoff"];
```

Sample output:
```plain-text
Stefan Stojanovic
Michael Stevens
....
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...in`)
- built-in methods (`zip`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You can use a `for...in` loop and the built-in `zip` method to go through both lists and output them pair by pair.
