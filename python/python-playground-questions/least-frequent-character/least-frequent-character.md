# Least Frequent Character

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **takes a string as input**
> - **determines which characters appear the least**
> - **print the least occurring character along with its number of occurrences**

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...in`, `if (age > 1)...`)
- variable creation (`age = 33`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use a loop to cycle through every character and save it in an empty dictionary. 

Within the loop you can check if the character already exists, if it does, increase its count and if it doesn't, add it.

Here's one example of a dictionary:
```python
{
  a: 5,
  b: 3,
  # ...
}
```

After the loop is made, output the least occurring value from the dictionary.

Here's one way you can get the least occurring character from a dictionary: 

```python
min(dict, key = dict.get))
```
