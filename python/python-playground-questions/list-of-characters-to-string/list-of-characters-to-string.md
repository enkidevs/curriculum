## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to **create a program that joins a list of characters into a string and outputs the result**.

Sample list of characters to use:
```python
characters = [
	  'h', 
	  'e', 
	  'l', 
	  'l', 
	  'o', 
	  ' ', 
	  'w', 
	  'o', 
	  'r', 
	  'l', 
	  'd'
]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)
- loops (`for...in...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create an empty string and use a `for...of` loop to go through every character of the list, concatenating each character to the empty string.
