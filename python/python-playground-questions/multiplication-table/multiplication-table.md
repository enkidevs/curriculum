# Multiplication Table

---

## Content

Can you create a program that will display the multiplication table for any number between 1 and 10 (both included)?

If the input is `5`, the output should look similar to this:
```python
# Version 3
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2, 4, 6, 8, 10
3, 6, 9, 12, 15
4, 8, 12, 16, 20
5, 10, 15, 20, 25
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 25`)
- built-in (`range()`)
- flow control (`for...in`)

As a bonus, print the table with equal spacing between each number, like this:

```python
1       2       3       4       5
2       4       6       8       10
3       6       9       12      15
4       8       12      16      20
5       10      15      20      25
```

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two loops to print the table. Both loops cycle from 1 to the given number.

The outer loop prints each row and the inner loop builds the row string.
