# Pascal Triangle

---

## Content

The Pascal triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients.

Here is a gif from Wikipedia that demonstrates how each value is calculated:

![wiki-explanation](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Triangle#/media/File:PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

Can you write a program that will print the Pascal triangle exactly like in the above gif?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 22`)
- loops (`for...in:`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

The left-most and right-most values of every row are `1`.

Every line has a number of integers equal to the line number.

The first two rows have only `1`s.

The values between the left and right bound of every row are equal to the sum of values just above them.

Use nested loops.
