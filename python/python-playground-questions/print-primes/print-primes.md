> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **outputs the first 15 prime numbers.**

> A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

The first 15 primes fall in the range `2`-`50`. Some of them are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

2 is only divisible by 1 and itself, making it prime. 4 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, and itself.

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- built-in function (`range()`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a `for x in...` loop that will range from 2 to 50. 

Then use a conditional statement to check if a number is larger than 1 (all primes are). 

Inside the conditional use a second loop in the range of 2 to `x`.

If `x` divided by the second loop variable is equal to 0 break out of the loop, otherwise output the prime.
