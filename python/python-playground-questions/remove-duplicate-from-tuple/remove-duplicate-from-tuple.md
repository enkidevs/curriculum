# Remove Duplicate Values From a Tuple

---

## Content

Given a tuple with repeating words, can you define a function that will take a tuple as input, remove the duplicates, and output the result?

Tuple:
```python
myTuple = ("Stefan", "Mark", "Joane","Steven", "Natasha", "Mark", "Steven", "Mark", "Natasha")
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function definition (`def something(x):`)
- flow control (`if(x > 1)`, `for...in...:`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def duplicateRemoval(t):
```

You can convert the `tuple` to a `list`, use the `.count()` list method to see which value appears 2 or more times, then remove the duplicates using `.remove()`.

Don't forget to convert the `list` back to a `tuple` before returning it.
