# Remove Odd Numbers From a List

---

## Content

Given the list:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Can you create a program that will traverse through each number in the given list, remove the number if it is odd, and save the new list with only even numbers?

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- conditional statements (`if (x>1)...`)
- built-in method (`remove()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You need two lists. The first one is already created; `numbers`. The second one is empty and will hold the odd numbers.

Use a loop to cycle through and a conditional statement to check whether a number is odd and add it to the second list if it is.
