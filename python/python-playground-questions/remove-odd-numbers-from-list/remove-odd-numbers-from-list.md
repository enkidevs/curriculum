# Remove Odd Numbers From a List

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **removes all odd numbers from a list and outputs the result.**

Example list to use:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- conditional statements (`if (x>1)...`)
- built-in method (`remove()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You need two `list`s. The first one is already created; `numbers`. The second one is empty and will hold the odd numbers.

Use a loop to cycle through and a conditional statement to check whether a number is odd and add it to the second list if it is.
