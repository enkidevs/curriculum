# Remove Odd Numbers From a List

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that:
> - **takes a list as input**
> - **removes all odd numbers from it**
> - **outputs the even-numbered list**

Example list to use:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- conditional statements (`if (x>1)...`)
- built-in method (`remove()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You need two `list`s. The first one is already created; `numbers`. The second one is empty and will hold the odd numbers.

Use a loop to cycle through and a conditional statement to check whether a number is odd and add it to the second list if it is.
