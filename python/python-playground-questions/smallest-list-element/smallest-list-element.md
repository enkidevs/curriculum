> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that **outputs the smallest number from a list.**

Example list to use:
```python
numbers = [33, 99, 41, 73, 2, 21, 1, 18]
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- built-in function (`len()`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Save the first number as the smallest.

Use a loop and a conditional statement to cycle through all numbers and if there is a smaller number, override the existing one.

Print the smallest value after the loop.
