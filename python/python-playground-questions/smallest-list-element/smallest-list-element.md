## Content

Can you create a program that will output the smallest and largest number from a given list?

Here is the list:
```python
numbers = [33, 99, 41, 73, 2, 21, 1, 18]
```

To achieve this, you can use some of the following concepts:
- loops (`for...in...`)
- built-in function (`len()`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Save the first number as the smallest.

Use a loop and a conditional statement to cycle through all numbers and if there is a smaller number, override the existing one.

Print the smallest value after the loop.
