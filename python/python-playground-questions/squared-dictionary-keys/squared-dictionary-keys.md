# Squared Dictionary Keys

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a `squareRoot` dictionary. It should:
> - **have keys that go from 1 to 10 (bounds included)**
> - **the value of each key should be the square of the key**

Example solution:
```python
{
  1: 1, 
  2: 4, 
  3: 9, 
  4: 16, 
  5: 25, 
  6: 36, 
  7: 49, 
  8: 64, 
  9: 81, 
  10: 100
}
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- loops (`for...in...:`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating an empty dictionary.

Then using a loop, go through every element in the range of `1` to `11`.

Assign each value the squared value of the key.
