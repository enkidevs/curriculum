## Content

Can you make a program that will take a sentence as input and output the total number of letters? The program should ignore spaces.

```python
# Input
"Elon Musk"

# Output
8
```

To achieve this, you can use some of the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30)`, `for...in`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

> ðŸ’¡ The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

> ðŸ¤“ Happy learning! Open the playground and start coding!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use two variables; one for the `string` and the other as a `counter`.

Use a loop to go through each character of the sentence. Increase the `counter` if the character is not a space.
