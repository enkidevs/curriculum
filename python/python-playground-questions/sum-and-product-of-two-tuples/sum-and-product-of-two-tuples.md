# Sum and Product of two Tuples

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to define a function that:
> - **takes two tuples as input**
> - **sums up the values in each tuple**
> - **multiplies the sumed values**
> - **outputs the result**

Example tuples:
```python
first = (1, 3, 5)

second = (2, 4, 6)
```

The result would be (1 + 3 + 5) * (2 + 4 + 6) = 108

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function definition (`def something(x):`)
- variable creation (`age = 30`)
- built-in methods (`sum()`, `list()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def tupleAddition(a, b):
```

Convert the tuples into lists and sum their values. Return the product of the summed values.
