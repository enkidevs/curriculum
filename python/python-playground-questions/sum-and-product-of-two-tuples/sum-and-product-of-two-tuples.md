# Sum and Product of two Tuples

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to define a function that:
> - **takes two tuples as input**
> - **sums up the values in each tuple**
> - **multiplies the sumed values**
> - **outputs the result**

Example tuples:
```python
first = (1, 3, 5)

second = (2, 4, 6)
```

The result would be (1 + 3 + 5) * (2 + 4 + 6) = 108

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def something(x):`)
- variable creation (`age = 30`)
- built-in methods (`sum()`, `list()`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining and naming your function.

Ex:
```python
def tupleAddition(a, b):
```

Convert the tuples into lists and sum their values. Return the product of the summed values.
