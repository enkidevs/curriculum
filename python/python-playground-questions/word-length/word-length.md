> 👩‍💻 Your task is to define a function that **splits a sentence into separate words and only outputs words longer than four letters**.

Example input/output:
```python
# Input
myFunction('Mary had a little lamb')

# Output:
little
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...in...`, `if (x > 4)...`)
- built-in functions (`len()`, `split()`)
- function creation (`def something(x):`)

ive it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a function with an input variable. 

> You can use (`.split()`).

Use a loop to cycle through every word and a conditional statement to only output words longer that four letters.

> You can use (`len()`)
