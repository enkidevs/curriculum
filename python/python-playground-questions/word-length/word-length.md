## Content

Can you define a function that will take a sentence as input? The function should split the sentence into separate words and only output words longer than 4 letters?

Example input/output:
```python
# Input
myFunction('Mary had a little lamb')

# Output:
little
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...in...`, `if (x > 4)...`)
- built-in functions (`len()`, `split()`)
- function creation (`def something(x):`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1].

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a function with an input variable. 

> You can use (`.split()`).

Use a loop to cycle through every word and a conditional statement to only output words longer that four letters.

> You can use (`len()`)
