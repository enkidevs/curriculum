    # Find which two numbers of the given numbers list, when summed up, equal the target value. Return their indices.

    # Sample list and target values to use:
    numbers = [1, 2, 4, 7, 12]
    target1 = 6
    target2 = 11

    # Type your code here:

    print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target1))  
    # (1, 2)

    print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target2))  
    # (2, 3)

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Find which two numbers of the given `numbers` list, when summed up, equal the `target` value. Return their indices.**

Sample program:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 7, 12]
target1 = 6
target2 = 11

print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target1))  
# (1, 2)

print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target2))  
# (2, 3)
```
