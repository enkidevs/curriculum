# What Are Flow Control Statements?

---

## Content

Flow Control statements are an important part of any programming language, and **R** is no exception. Flow Control, also called **Conditional** statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

There are three types of conditional statements in **R**: `if`, `if-else`, and `switch` statements.

These conditional statements are an important tool for controlling the flow of your program. They allow you to specify different code paths to execute based on different conditions, and make it possible to write programs that can adapt to different inputs and situations.

For example, you could use a conditional statement to check whether a user has entered a valid password before allowing them to log in to your program, or to check whether a file exists before trying to read or write to it.
