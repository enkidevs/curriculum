# Let’s Create Our First Program

---

## Content

"Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. It is often used as a starting point when learning a new programming language.

In **R**, you can print text to the screen using the `print()` function. Here is an example of a "Hello, World!" program in **R**:
```r
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run the program, you can write the code into the **R** console, or you can save it to a script file with the `.R` extension and run it using the `source()` function.
```r
# Save the code to a file called "hello.R"

# In the R console, type:
source("hello.R")
```

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the screen.
