# Intro to Loops

---

## Content

Loops are a fundamental programming concept that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

In **R**, you can use loops to perform tasks such as iterating over the elements of an array, data frame, or list, or to execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.

There are three types of loops in **R**: `for` loops, `while` loops, and `repeat` loops.
