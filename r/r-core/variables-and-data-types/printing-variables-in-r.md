# print & cat

---

## Content

To print[1] a message to the console in **R**, you can use the `print()` function. For example:
```r
print("Hello, world!")
```

You can also use the `cat()` function to print a message. The `cat()` function is similar to `print()`, but it does not add a newline after the message. For example:
```r
cat("Hello, world!")
```

## Practice

Print a message to the console without adding a newline character after the message:
```r
???("Hello, world!")
```

- `cat`
- `print`
