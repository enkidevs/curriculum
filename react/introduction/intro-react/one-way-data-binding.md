# One way data binding

---
## Content

**React** encourages **unidirectional data flow** by design and lets you describe the way your application keeps the `view` in sync with the data `model` using an HTML-like language called JSX. This process is called **one-way data binding**[1].

In **one-way data binding**, the `model` is the *single source of truth*. Instead of changing the `model` directly when a **UI field** changes, the `model` is notified by the intended change and updates the *state* itself. Afterwards, the `view` is updated to match the change.

This technique is often seen as *cleaner* and it's preferred because it gives better control over the **data flow**.

## Footnotes

[1: Two-way data binding]
Although React uses one-way data binding, there is also two-way data binding. By this we mean that the `model` is dynamically bound to the `view` such that one can change the other and vice-versa:
- when you update a property in the model, the UI is also updated
- when you update the UI, the data model is also changed
