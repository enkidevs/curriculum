# Intro Components

## Content

One of the main concepts and the building block of React is the component.

You can think of a component as a definition representing one or more UI elements. For example, a component can represent:

- a header with an image
- a list of links
- a button

Here's an example of a React component:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href='#'>Enki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='#'>Is</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='#'>Cool</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This component will display:

Don't worry too much about components now as we will talk more about them in the following workouts.

For now, itâ€™s enough to understand that components in React represent definitions of UI elements.
