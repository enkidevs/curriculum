# Self-closing tags in JSX

---
## Content

**JSX** is a JavaScript syntax extension that is widely used together with **React**, even though plain JavaScript can also be used.

**JSX** gives the opportunity to use self-closing tags and not only the default closing format.

Normal tags:
```javascript
<MyComponent>
</MyComponent>
```

Self-closed tag:
```javascript
<MyComponent />
```
Keep in mind that while `<div /> ` alone is a valid tag, `<div>` is not if it's not closed.
