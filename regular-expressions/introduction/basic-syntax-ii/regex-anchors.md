## Content

So far we've written regular expressions that can *partially match*[1] pieces of text, but this isn't always desirable!

Imagine if we wanted to match the word `success`, but our text also included the word `unsuccessful`. Our pattern would match on this too...

This is where **anchors** come in handy.

> üí° The `^` is used to signify the *start of a string*, and the `$` character is used to signify the *end of a string*.

```
/^success/
```

The string must start with `success`.

`success` ‚úÖ
unsuccessful ‚ùå

```
/.+\.$/
```

The string can have one or more character but must end with a `'.'`.

`sentence ending.` ‚úÖ
sentence ending? ‚ùå

Note that `^` has different uses depending on whether it's inside or outside of square brackets , [^...]. This is where it's used to *exclude characters*.

## Practice

Which regex pattern would match with the first line of text? 

???

`Mission: successful`	‚úÖ
Last Mission: unsuccessful ‚ùå
Next Mission: successful upon capture of target ‚ùå

* `/^(Mission: successful)/`
* `/\A(Mission: successful)/`
* `/(^Mission: successful)/`
* `/[^Mission: successful]/`

## Revision

Which regex pattern would match with the first line of text? 

???

`text ends with abc`	‚úÖ
abc is at the start ‚ùå
text has abc inside it ‚ùå

* `/.*(abc)$/`
* `/^(abc).*/`
* `/.*(abc)\z/`
* `/.*$(abc)/`

## Footnotes

[1:Partial matching]
Partial matches are when the regex pattern matches some, but not all of the text. An example of partial matching would be if we used `/\w/` to attempt to match all of the following text:

'let's match this text...'

`/\w/` partially matches on any word character, but it misses the punctuation marks and white spaces.

We could use the regex pattern `/.+/` to match the entire text.

`let's match this text` ‚úÖ
