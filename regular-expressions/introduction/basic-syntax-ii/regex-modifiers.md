# Modifiers

---
## Content

Modifiers change the *whole nature of our regex pattern*. 

They're written outside of the `//` like so:

```plain-text
/hello/i
```

The `i` modifier makes the whole regex pattern case insensitive, so the following would all match:

`hello`, `Hello`, `HeLlO`, `HELLO` ✅✅✅✅

The `m` modifier makes the `^` and `$` anchors match the *start and end of a new line* rather than an entire string.

A regex expression with an `m` modifier would allow the pattern to check across multiple lines:

```plain-text
/^(start|another).*(line)$/m
```

```plain-text
start of a line
another line
```       

> 💡 When using Ruby, the anchors `^` and `$` always match on all lines. There is no way to turn this option off. This is actually quite a nice way to do things as there are separate anchors for the beginning and end of strings: `\A`, `\Z` and `\z`.

There are many more modifiers which you can read about [here](https://www.regular-expressions.info/refmodifiers.html).
