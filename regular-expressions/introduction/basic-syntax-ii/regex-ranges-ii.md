# Ranges II

---
## Content

As with most patterns in regex, we can write the opposite of what we want in a very simple way.

Say we want all letters and numbers outside of the ranges 'a-c' and '1-3' then we can use the hat/caret character, `^`, inside the square brackets to exclude these characters.

```
/[^a-c1-3]/
```

abc123 ❌
`def5678` ✅

This means that the following is true:

`[^a-zA-Z0-9_]` is equivalent to `\W`

`[^0-9]` is equivalent to `\D`

Most patterns can be written using the technique from the previous insight as they are really *two sides of the same coin*. 

By having both choices, you can decide which one is easier to write and understand when creating your own patterns.

## Practice

Using the '^' character, which regex pattern matches `hog` and `dog`, but not `bog`.

???

* /[^b]og/
* /[b]og/
* /[hd]og/
* /[^hd]og/

## Revision

*Using the hat character*, which regex pattern matches `fun`, `pun`, but not `bun`.

???

* /[^b]un/
* /[fp]un/
* /[b]un/
* /[^fp]un/
