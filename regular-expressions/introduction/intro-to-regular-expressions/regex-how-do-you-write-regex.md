# What's the syntax?

## Content

Regex patterns are formatted slightly differently depending on the programming language you're using. In JavaScript, Ruby and several other languages regex patterns are written between two forward slashes, `/`, and this is how we'll be displaying them over the next few workouts.

```
/<insert Regex here>/
```

Imagine that we have a string equal to `'Learning Regex is fun'` and we set our regex pattern to `/fun/`, then the match result from the string would be `'fun'`:

Learning Regex is `fun`

If we changed our regex pattern to `/FUN/` then we wouldn't return any match results as *capitalization matters*.

You'll soon learn about all the different ways you can alter your regex pattern to account for capitalization, as well as numbers, special characters and ranges.

## Practice

When using JavaScript or Ruby, valid regex patterns must be written between ???.

* `/ /`
* `\ \`
* `< >`
* `> <`

## Revision

The regex pattern `/FUN/` matches part of the text `'regex is fun'`.

???

* False
* True
