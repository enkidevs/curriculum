# Email Address Checker II

---
## Content

There are so many different ways that we could write our email address checker. 

Here's another way that allows an optional domain name extension, like `co.uk`, but which also works for `.com`:

```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/
```

It looks like a lot, but don't be put off! ðŸ˜…

Let's take a look at each major chunk.

`/[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_{|}~-]+/` gives all of the allowed email address characters, and ensures that there's at least one of them.

`/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+/` ensures that the host name is alphanumeric and has at least one character.

`/(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*/` this is the optional part. It ensure that there must be zero or more instances of that group, so `.com` would match, but also `.co.uk`.

Pretty neat stuff! 

Regex is an awesome tool for making basic validations, but the more compliant you want to be then the more obscure the regex becomes.
