# Passwords using Positive Lookaheads


---

## Content

Password validation works best when we use a regex operator called a **positive lookahead**. 

This will search for the pattern inside the text to make sure it appears *at least once*, but the important thing is that the *order of where it appears doesn't matter*.

Positive lookaheads start with `/(?=)/`. For example:

`/(?=.*[a-z])/` means that there must be at least one *lower case letter*.

`/(?=.*[A-Z])/` means that there must be at least one *upper case letter*.

`/(?=.*\d)/` means that there must be at least one *digit*.

`/(?=.*\W)/` means that there must be at least one *symbol*.

If we add these positive lookaheads into our password validator, our regex pattern will look like this:

```plain-text
/(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*\W).{8,}/
```

`Password123!` ‚úÖ
password123! ‚ùå

There are two more things we can add to make it fully watertight.

`^` and `$` make sure the match starts at the beginning of a word and ends with the word. Essentially, only whole word matches are allowed. Partial matches aren‚Äôt considered.

Our password validator in one line of regex üéâ:

```plain-text
/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*\W).{8,}$/
```

## Practice

What's the correct syntax for a positive lookahead to check that a password must have at least one word character, regardless of capitalization?

???

- `/(?=.*\w)/`
- `/(?=.*\W)/`
- `/(?=.*[a-zA-Z])/`
- `/(?=.*\S)/`

## Revision

What's the correct syntax for a positive lookahead to check that a password must have at least one upper case letter?

???

- `/(?=.*[A-Z])/`
- `/(?=.*\W)/`
- `/(?=.*[A-Z]{1})/`
- `/(?=.*\S)/`
