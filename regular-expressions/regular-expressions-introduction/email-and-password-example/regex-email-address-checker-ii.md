# Email Address Checker II


---

## Content

We could write our email address checker in so many different ways.

Here's another way that allows an optional domain name extension, like `co.uk`, but which also works for `.com`:

```plain-text
/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/
```

It looks like a lot, but don't be put off! ðŸ˜…

Let's take a look at each significant chunk.

`/[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_{|}~-]+/` gives all of the allowed email address characters and ensures that there's at least one of them.

`/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+/` ensures that the hostname is alphanumeric and has at least one character.

`/(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*/` this is the optional part. It ensures that there must be zero or more instances of that group, so `.com` would match, but also `.co.uk`.

Pretty neat stuff!

Regex is an incredible tool for making basic validations, but the more compliant you want to be, the more obscure the regex becomes.
