# What's the syntax?

## Content

Regex patterns are formatted slightly differently depending on the programming language you're using. In JavaScript, Ruby and several other languages regex patterns are written between two forward slashes, `/`, and this is how we'll be displaying them over the next few workouts.

```plain-text
/<insert Regex here>/
```

Imagine that we have a string equal to `'Learning Regex is fun'` and we set our regex pattern to `/fun/`, then the match result from the string would be `'fun'`:

Learning Regex is `fun`

If we changed our regex pattern to `/FUN/` then we wouldn't return any match results as *capitalization matters*.

You'll soon learn about all the different ways you can alter your regex pattern to account for capitalization, as well as numbers, special characters and ranges.

## Practice

When using JavaScript or Ruby, valid regex patterns must be written between as

```js
???enki???
```

- `/`
- `/`
- `\`
- `\`
- `<`
- `>`
- `>`
- `<`

## Revision

The regex pattern `/FUN/` matches part of the text `'regex is fun'`.
