# What are Regular Expressions?


---

## Content

**Regular expressions** (regex or regexp for short) are *patterns of letters, numbers and non-alphanumeric characters.*

> They can be used to find matching patterns in other texts.

You can think of regular expressions as wildcards[1] on steroids 💪.

Although we can use regex to find *direct matches*, it's more commonly used for  *pattern matching*.

Imagine if you wanted to find your birthday in a long list of birthdays that are all in the DD-MM-YYYY format. You would go to the list and find a date that exactly matches your birthday.

Now what if you wanted to find all mentioned dates in your class syllabus?

You can't use direct matching. This is where regular expressions can help.

Instead of searching for one exact date, you can search for any text that matches the DD-MM-YYYY shape. 🤯

## Footnotes

[1:Wildcards]
A wildcard character is a kind of placeholder represented by a single character, such as an asterisk `*` or percentage sign `%`. Wildcards can be interpreted as *multiple characters or an empty string*.

Wildcards are often used in file searches so that the full name doesn't need to be typed out. They're also commonly used in SQL to match zero or more characters.
