# Why Learn Regex?


---

## Content

Regex is for *everyone*.

> 💡 A developer could use regex to validate that information given by a user is in the correct format.

For example, when collecting email addresses on a sign up form, the `@` character must be in the correct position for the email address to be valid. If it isn't, then our form should throw an error.

`@gmail.com` ❌

Developers can use regex to construct a pattern that the users' input must match.

`devs@enki.com` ✅

> 💡 A non-developer could also use regex to ensure that email addresses are valid by making use of spreadsheets or online tools.

Spreadsheet tools like Google Sheets have built in regex formulas to match, extract and replace. Take a look at the **Learn More** link to discover these formulas.

We'll share a few of our favorite online tools with you soon!
