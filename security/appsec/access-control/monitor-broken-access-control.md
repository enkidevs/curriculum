# Monitor Broken Access Control

---
## Content

Monitoring and logging can help identify and mitigate incumbent problems around access control. They can also help clean up the damage after many kinds of attacks , such as allowing you to reverse malicious use of the program.

In your application, ensure that all access to the system is logged, but _especially all credentialed access_. Ensure that your application logs the following data:

* the IP address, geolocation, and other identifying data about the client (browser, etc)
* The credential presented (or ID number in the case of a physical credential)
* The time and date
* The resource visited and action taken
* The result of the determination of the validity of the credential

The reasoning behind the last one is that if a user is attempting to use a credential that is not valid, you may be able to identify anomalous use based on some pattern of use. For example, a web-crawler may systematically try each URL in turn with a credential it believes to be valid, but a user may not exhibit this behavior. You may or may not put automated defenses at this level, but this is undoubtedly helpful for diagnosing credentials that are being abused.

## Practice

Why does logging and monitoring access control help identify access control vulnerabilities?

???

* You will be able to identify anomalous use
* You can prove who did what
* You will be able to prove you weren't involved

## Revision

Make sure to log what information in order to properly monitor access control violations:  

The IP address, geolocation, and other identifying data about the client  
The ??? presented  
The time and date  
The resource visited and action taken  
The result of ???  

* credential
* the determination of the validity of the credential
* The user's name
* The number of times the user has presented this credential
