# Deserialization

---

## Content

Deserialization vulnerabilities mostly come from unsanitized input, thus reiterating one of the best things you can do for security inside your organization: always sanitize your inputs!

Deserialization vulnerability exposes two main vectors of attack:

- Allowing the contents of a serialized object affect behavior or application logic that is recorded or executed on the server
- Data tampering, where client-side logic is thwarted by modifying calls to the server

## Practice

What's the best way to prevent a deserialization attack?

???

- Sanitize your inputs
- Use XML instead of JSON
- Don't accept any inputs

## Revision

???

- Data Tampering and Logic Tampering
- Payload Bombs and Billion Laughs
- Data Injection and Malicious Code Execution
- Denial of Service and Resource Consumption
