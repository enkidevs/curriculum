# Deserialization


---

## Content

Deserialization vulnerabilities mostly come from unsanitized input, thus reiterating one of the best things you can do for security inside your organization: always sanitize your inputs!

Deserialization vulnerability exposes two main vectors of attack:

* Allowing the contents of a serialized object affect behavior or application logic that is recorded or executed on the server
* Data tampering, where client-side logic is thwarted by modifying calls to the server
