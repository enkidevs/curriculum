# OWASP & Open Source Initiatives

---
## Content

OWASP (short for The Open Web Application Security Project) is part of a not-for-profit group that aggregates common security flaws and vulnerabilities in networked applications, and provides practical mitigation strategies. This is one of the most beginner-friendly organizations that makes up the vast body of application security. 

The best investment of most peoples' time when working on AppSec involves finding these organizations that maintain lists of vulnerabilities and scanning tools, and using these lists and tools to search your application for vulnerabilities.

Much of your practice as a Security Engineer means finding and monitoring lists of common vulnerabilities - you can't possibly do all the research yourself. You'll want to form a habit of glancing at the headlines and top vulnerability lists, to make sure major outbreaks don't affect you.

Bookmark this insight to receive links to other resources and lists of best practices to get started. Take a look once per day if you want to get really immersed in the information security world. Take a look once per week or month if you're trying to stay on top of vulnerabilities for your every-day job as your main responsibility.
