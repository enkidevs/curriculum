# OWASP & Open Source Initiatives

---
## Content

Much of your practice as a Security Engineer means finding and monitoring lists of common vulnerabilities.

Because it's impossible to do all the research yourself, you'll want to form a habit of checking the headlines and top vulnerability lists.

**OWASP** (short for The Open Web Application Security Project) is part of a not-for-profit group that aggregates common security flaws and vulnerabilities in networked applications.

It provides practical mitigation strategies, and is one of the most beginner-friendly organizations that makes up the vast body of application security. 

> 💡 Check the Learn More section for a list of common vulnerabilities and exploits.
