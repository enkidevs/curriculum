## Content

AppSec is a diverse field that means more than just keeping current on vulnerability research. It's something everyone needs to know at some level, so that when major outbreaks occur they can take steps to protect themselves and the applications they develop. At more advanced levels, it means strictly following regulatory guidelines to ensure certain kinds of data are very well protected. At very advanced levels, it can mean research, penetration testing, and more.

If you'd like to learn more about application security, you should make sure you have a strong foundation in the following:

- The __Open Systems Interconnection Model__ (OSI Model) (covered in this course)
- At least one scripting language (even bash, check out our other topics)
- Network Protocols (check our Networking course!)
- Operating Systems
- How memory in a computer works, and where data is located at any given time

The next topics to explore, once you have those ready:
- Automated Exploit Tooling
- Intrusion Detection Tooling
- Cryptography
