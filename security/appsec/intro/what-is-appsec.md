## Content

AppSec (short for Application security) is simply a set of measures taken to improve the security of an application; often by finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities. 

The field of application security includes many different individuals working together to ensure the safety of applications around the world; from security researchers, to bug bounty hunters, to open-source reviewers, to algorithm developers, to the vast legions of engineers who are vigilant against common security flaws. Many organizations work together to share knowledge about how to identify and counteract threats and secure attack vectors.

This course aims to introduce you to common security patterns that you can follow in your code, your application design, and your organization - to be more secure, and keep your customers' data safe.

In order to improve application security, we'll make use of many automated tools to make the process more automatic, and integrate it into your normal developer workflow.
