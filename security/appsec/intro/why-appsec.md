## Content

Long forgotten are the days when application security was considered optional.

With more and more data being generated every year, companies need to make sure that their users' data is safe.

Take a look at Adobe. In 2013 they lost almost **3 million credit card records** and an undetermined amount of user accounts.

This whole ordeal ended up costing them **1 million dollars**. Ouch!

There are many reasons for making your app secure, and here are a few of them:

* **reputation** (users don't trust an app that is known for its security problems)
* **keep the data safe** (in case of a data breach, you can incur penalties according to legislation in multiple countries)
* **your own information can be used against you** (proprietary information leaking out, blackmailing, and others)
* **Google rankings** (you get less points if you don't follow security best practices which translates to less traffic)
