# Identifying the Application Layer


---

## Content

**The Application Layer** (Layer 7) is highest on the stack and **most broad** in definition. 

It can be considered a catch-all for anything outside of the concerns of the lower layers.

This layer is represented by the user interface, which is responsible for displaying the information received.

In the **Application Layer** live programs using protocols such as:

- naming (DNS)
- file transfer (HTTP, FTP)
- messaging (SMTP, IRC)
- remote access (Telnet, SSH)
- countless more 

These programs are designed for human interaction (via GUI[1]) and utilize high-level functions that interact with the network.

> 💡 Due to its high level of variance and loose security standards, this layer is the most vulnerable to exploits.

## Practice

What role does the Application Layer play in the OSI 7 Layer Model?

???

- Provide a user interface with high-level functions for interacting with the network
- Opening, closing, and managing connections between applications
- Maintaining and ensuring a stable connection between two hosts over the Internet
- Transmitting data between network nodes
- Routing and transmission over the physical topography of the Internet
- Providing computational power via electronic circuits
- Packaging data packets into data streams and vice versa for transport

## Revision

In the Application Layer is ???.

- anything not covered in the lower Layers
- programs that use a GUI
- programs that use TCP-based protocols
- programs that do not require network access

## Footnotes

[1: GUI]

**GUI** (short for **graphical user interface**) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software.

It allows users to interact with the software through graphical icons and audio indicators, instead of text-based user interfaces.
