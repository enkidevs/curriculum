# Identifying the Network Layer

---

## Content

The **Network Layer** (Layer 3) is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through different routers.

For example, your computer in London is trying to connect to a server in San Francisco. Because there is more than one path that it can take, the **Network Layer** helps it choose the most efficient one.

> The **Network Layer** relays requests from the **Transport Layer** (Layer 4) to the **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2).

Some functions of the **Network Layer** include:
- connectionless communication
  - data packets can travel from sender to recipient, without the recipient having to acknowledge receipt
- host addressing
  - each host in the network must have a unique address, commonly known as IP (Internet Protocol) address
- message forwarding
  - due to the nature of how networks are partitioned, gateways (or routers) must be used to forward packets between them
