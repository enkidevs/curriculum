# Identifying the Physical Layer


---

## Content

The Physical Layer (Layer 1) is responsible for physical communication between end devices, via electronic voltage (copper cables) or electromagnetic waves (wireless). 

It acts as an intermediary between the hardware of the device and the **Data Link Layer** above it, converting bitstreams[1] from the hardware into logical packets for transmitting and vice versa.

The Physical Layer encompasses all electronic circuit transmission technologies on a given network. 

These include but are not limited to: 

- ethernet
- network hubs
- the USB physical layer
- the Bluetooth physical layer
- various wireless cards

A wider definition of the Physical Layer may include physical mediums and power supplies.

## Practice

What role does the Physical Layer play in the OSI 7 Layer Model?

???

- Providing transmission between end devices via voltage or wavelengths.
- Transmitting data between network nodes
- Routing and transmission over the physical topography of the Internet
- Packaging data packets into data streams and vice versa for transport
- Providing a user interface

- raw bitstreams
- wavelengths
- packets
- light

## Footnotes

[1: Bitstreams]
A bitstream (or a binary sequence), is a sequence of bits.
