# Introducing the OSI Model


---

## Content

The **Open Systems Interconnection Model** (OSI Model) is a model for standardizing networks across various hardware configurations.

![alt description](https://img.enkipro.com/56087819d55f794aab9ac03a5e7c9aff.png)

The model is displayed as a stack to show that each Layer requires every other layer below it to function, but does not need *any* of the layers above it to function. 

For example, the bottom-most layer (the **Physical Layer**) is the physical wiring needed to transmit electrical current throughout the network. 

All the services above it need this to function, but the physical wires themselves do not have any dependencies.

The following workouts will go into detail about the responsibilities of each layer, and how they function in a network. 

> No two networks are the same, and as such the goal of the OSI Model is to be less of a hard rule and more of **a flexible guideline**.
