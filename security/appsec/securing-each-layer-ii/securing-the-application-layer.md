# Securing the Application Layer

---
## Content

The open-ended and ever-changing nature of the Application Layer means that many vulnerabilities are grouped together in it. Anything developed by a programmer falls under this Layer, and since programmers are human, accidents happen. At best, these errors can cause crashes and unexpected behavior. At worst, software errors can result in stolen/destroyed data, physical damage, and backdoor access being created on the network node.

One could control these vulnerabilities by utilizing a test suite to ensure that the application they are making is bug-free _before_ it goes out to the public. Writing [comprehensive bug reports](https://musescore.org/en/developers-handbook/how-write-good-bug-report-step-step-instructions) and sending them to the appropriate party, or using [GitHub Issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/) if the project is Open Source, helps to resolve these types of issues more quickly. Hackers will never stop finding new and exciting exploits in technology. It's up to developers to stay up to date on the latest attack vectors and design their products with security in mind.

Finally, **YOU are responsible for your security**. Do not run unfamiliar programs without checking that they are from a reputable source and free of viruses and unresolved errors. [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload) is a great cloud-based virus scanner, and [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) is a great source of transparent, comprehensive bug reports.
