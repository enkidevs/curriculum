# OWASP & Open Source Initiatives


---

## Content

Much of your practice in working with security means finding and monitoring lists of common vulnerabilities.

Because it's impossible to do all the research yourself, you'll want to form a habit of checking the headlines and top vulnerability lists.

**OWASP** (short for The Open Web Application Security Project) is part of a not-for-profit group that aggregates common security flaws and vulnerabilities in networked applications.

It provides practical mitigation strategies, and is one of the most beginner-friendly organizations that makes up the vast body of application security. 

> 💡 Check out the Learn More section for a list of common vulnerabilities and exploits.

In this Security course we'll teach you:

- The **Open Systems Interconnection Model** (OSI Model)
- How to apply appropriate controls to minimize vulnerability
- How to identify and mitigate different attacks
- How to evaluate source code for vulnerabilities
- How to identify and protect sensitive data
- And much more!

## Practice

A large part of application security involves:

???

- Monitoring aggregators and news sites for major vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
- Doing exploit analysis on your company's hardware
- Working closely with the database administrator
- Checking in with the security guards regularly


---

## Revision

OWASP is:

???

- An open source community of common security issues and techniques
- A hacking group
- A virus affecting wi-fi enabled microwaves
