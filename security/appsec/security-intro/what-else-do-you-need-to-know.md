## Content

AppSec is a diverse field that means more than just keeping current on vulnerability research[1].

Before diving into this skill, you should make sure you have a strong foundation in:

- Operating Systems
- How memory in a computer works, and where data is located at any given time
- At least one scripting language (even bash; check out our other skills)
- Network Protocols (check our **Linux - Networking** course)

> 💡 As with all the skills in the app, if you want to access more advanced or specific content at any time, **feel free to use the *Skill Map* tab** to jump to the workouts most relevant for you.

## Footnotes

[1:Levels of AppSec]
It's something everyone needs to know at some level. It enforces building a secure application from the start, or when major outbreaks occur they can take steps to protect themselves and the applications they develop

At more advanced levels, it means strictly following regulatory guidelines to ensure certain kinds of data are very well protected. At very advanced levels, it can mean research, penetration testing, and more.
