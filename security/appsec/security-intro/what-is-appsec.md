# What is AppSec?


---

## Content

**AppSec** (short for Application security) is simply a set of measures taken to improve the security of an application.

This is often done by finding, fixing, and preventing *security vulnerabilities*.

There have been many data breaches since the beginning of the internet, and they now represent the main reason for governments creating **data protection regulations**.

In 2019, [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/state-of-software-security-report) reported that **more than 80%** of webapps have **at least one security flaw**.

If you thought that AppSec isn't for you, maybe this will change your mind.

> 💡 Many organizations work together to share knowledge about how to identify and counteract threats and secure attack vectors[1].
