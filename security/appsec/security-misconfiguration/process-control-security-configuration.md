## Content

Start by writing the questions- what are you trying to show the user how to do?
Write the Practice first, then the Revision. Then come back to the content.

## Practice

This question will be shown with the insight, and users will have just read the content.
It's best to use a code example here.

example:
Given this directory structure, change directories **from** `www/css` **to** `www/images/promo`:
```
- www
  - css
  - images
    - promo
  - js

```

`cd ???/???/???`

* ..
* images
* promo
* www
* js
* .
* ^

## Revision

Revision questions are shown without the insight, and users may never have seen the content. Use a code example or multiple choice question.
