# Process Control Security Configuration

## Content

The right time to review security settings on a cloud service is before it lands in production. After running automated tools, review default settings for cloud services prior to deployment to production. To help empower application developers, help review new cloud service integrations during the code review stage.

There is a great deal of pushback from the information security industry about Cloud Services. Cloud services save a great deal of time and money on the cost of custom software development- the use of new cloud services is inevitable in modern development.

Perform a penetration test on the service for the development or stage server to ensure that attackers cannot inappropriately access data. Most cloud service providers will have documentation or support professionals that can speak to the most common security misconfigurations. If there is no documentation or you need help, most cloud services offer paid support and training. Even half an hour of paid support time is worth knowing exactly how to configure the settings to prevent common attacks.
