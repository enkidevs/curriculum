# Use and Contribute To Automated Scanners


---

## Content

Automated Scanners are hacker-community projects that combine commonly known vulnerabilities into scripts that detect and report on them. Application Security Engineers can use and configure these scripts to test applications in order to reduce their vulnerability to automated attack, which accounts for most compromises today.

Detectify is one such scanner, which you can use to scan your website for vulnerabilities on the OWASP top ten, as well as common access control and security misconfiguration vulnerabilities. OWTF is another, free scanner by OWASP. OWASP provides training on how to use their scanner for free in videos on youtube.

If there is no automated exploit for a vulnerability you experienced, *you can submit it to Detectify*. They'll automate it and integrate it into their scanner, which is like inoculating the whole internet. This is how to advance your career as a white-hat application security engineer- notice and report vulnerabilities, and help keep the whole community secure.

## Practice

How do vulnerabilities get added to automated scanners?

???

- someone reports them and automates them
- neural networks use evolutionary algorithms to generate exploits
- vulnerability gnomes use their cybermagiks to pry them from the deep earth
