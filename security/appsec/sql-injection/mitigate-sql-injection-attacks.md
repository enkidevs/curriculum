# Mitigate SQL Injection Attacks

---

## Content

The best way to prevent SQL Injection attacks is to use a library designed to automatically escape parameterized queries. Most Object Relationship Mappers do this automatically, though it is your job to be sure of that. Every major language and database has a library for **Parameterized Queries**.

A few other steps you can take:

- Use limits and pagination to limit the amount of data that is disclosed
- Evaluate your ORM for SQL Injection vulnerability reports
- Always escape and sanitize inputs
- Log SQL Injection attempts to detect hostile IPs
