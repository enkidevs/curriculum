# Other forms of Injection attacks


---

## Content

Injection is not a new technique- attackers have been injecting input with malicious data for a long time.
Consider this URL example:

```plain-text
http://sensitive/cgi-bin/
  userData.pl?doc=user1.txt
```

Now what would happen, if a malicious user were to change it to this:

```plain-text
http://sensitive/cgi-bin/
  userData.pl?doc=/bin/ls|
```

This will execute the command `/bin/ls`.


---

## Practice

Modify the URL to execute `/bin/ls|`

```plain-text
http://sensitive/cgi-bin/
userData.pl?doc=???
```

- /bin/ls|
- ;ls|
- ;$bash% ls .


---

## Revision

Modify the URL to execute `;cat /etc/passwd`

```plain-text
http://sensitive/something.php?dir=???
```

- %3Bcat%20/etc/passwd
- ;cat /etc/passwd
- ;$bash% cat /etc/passwd
