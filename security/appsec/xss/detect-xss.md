# Detect XSS Vulnerabilities

---
## Content

In order to review source code to establish whether or not your application is vulnerable to XSS attacks, ask yourself the following questions:

- Does my application _store unvalidated input_?
- Does my application _write unescaped user input to the page_?
- Does my application _write unescaped user input to another page_?
- Do all of my endpoints contain _server side validation_?

Bookmark this insight to receive links to OWASP testing guides for XSS that you can use on your own applications.
