# Identifying the Application Layer

---
## Content

The Application Layer (Layer 7), highest on the stack and __most broad__ in definition, could be considered a catch-all for anything outside of the concerns of the lower Layers. In the Application Layer lives programs using protocols such as naming (DNS), file transfer (HTTP, FTP), messaging (SMTP, IRC), remote access (Telnet, SSH), and countless more. These programs are designed for human interaction (via GUI) and utilize high level functions that interact with the network.

Due to its high level of variance and loose security standards, this Layer is the most vulnerable to exploits.

## Practice

What role does the Application Layer play in the OSI 7 Layer Model?
???


* Provide a user interface with high level functions for interacting with the network
* Opening, closing, and managing connections between applications
* Maintaining and ensuring a stable connection between two hosts over the Internet
* Transmitting data between network nodes
* Routing and transmission over the physical topography of the Internet
* Providing computational power via electronic circuits
* Packaging data packets into data streams and vice versa for transport

* anything not covered in the lower Layers
* programs that use a GUI
* programs that use TCP-based protocols
* programs that do not require network access
