## Content

A War Game, also known as Capture the Flag, is a recreational team-based competition where a Red Team (Hackers) try to crack into a server/device set up and protected by a Blue Team (Security Engineers) to steal documents. These can occur over the course of a day, or even many months. 


This practice is based off the military exercise of the same name and is done to raise awareness of exploits and methods used by real-world hackers and how they can be prevented.
