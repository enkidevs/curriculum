# TO_DATE


---

## Content

The `=TO_DATE` function is used to convert a number to a date.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=TO_DATE(value)
```

Let's take a look at some examples:

```plain-text
=TO_DATE(0)
12/30/1899
```

This (`12/30/1899`) is the date that corresponds to the value of `0`.

Each increment of 1 is equivalent to adding a day.

```plain-text
=TO_DATE(1)
12/31/1899

=TO_DATE(2)
01/01/1900
```

> 💡 You can also use negative values if you want a date that is before `12/30/1899`.

```plain-text
TO_DATE(-1)
12/29/1899
```

> ⚠️ The `TO_DATE()` function expects a number as an input. 

It doesn't convert date formats as cells do. If we were to input a date (`10/10/2020`), the function interprets it as an arithmetic operation.

```plain-text
=TO_DATE(10/10/2010)

is equivalent to
=TO_DATE(0.000497512438)
```

You can reference cells that are formatted as a date because, behind the scenes, Sheets actually sees them as numbers.

That is why `0` corresponds to `12/30/1899`.

> 💡 You can also use decimal values with `TO_DATE`.

```plain-text
=TO_DATE(0.25)
12/30/1899 06:00:00 AM
```

The fractions are used to determine the time of day after midnight.

> 💡 If you use decimals in `TO_DATE` you have to format the cell as **Date time** to be able to view the time. 

Without proper formatting, `=TO_DATE(0)` and `=TO_DATE(0.25)` would look the same.
