# Always check function names


---

## Content

Spreadsheets have numerous functions you can use. Some of these functions have similar usage but different names and vice versa.

For instance, let's say we wanted to use the `COUNT` function to count how many numerical values are in a selected range of cells.

When we type `=COUNT` in a cell, we get multiple functions to choose from.

The `=COUNT()` function checks the number of numeric values. 

However, if we accidentally chose the `=COUNTA()` function, it would also count any non-numerical values.

Make sure you review which function you want before selecting it.

Luckily, each function has a small description of what it does under its name. So, all we have to do is check that and we're good to go.

Example of `=COUNT()` vs `=COUNTA()`:

As you can see in the example above, not checking your function names can give incorrect outputs which could yield problems.
