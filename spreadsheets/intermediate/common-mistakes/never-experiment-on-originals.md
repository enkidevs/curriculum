# Never experiment on your original sheet

---
## Content

We all love to experiment on already built spreadsheets. However, this can cause unwanted results.

An unwanted result could be you saving wrong data without having a history to go back to.

You could accidentally forget to undo just 1 number from an important cell which would give wrong calculations in the end result.

If you want to experiment on the current sheet, all you should do is create a duplicate.

To create a duplicate of your sheet, locate the sheet at the bottom of the screen.

![bottom-of-screen-sheets](https://img.enkipro.com/a7b6fb6929ddc6121bc1429fd7043180.png)

Left-click the arrow to open a drop-down menu.

In the drop-down menu there are several options:

`Duplicate` is used to create a new exact copy of the sheet in the same workbook.

`Copy` has 2 sub-options. You can create a copy in an existing workbook or a new one.

All 3 options do the same thing and are recommended when you want to experiment with your sheet.
