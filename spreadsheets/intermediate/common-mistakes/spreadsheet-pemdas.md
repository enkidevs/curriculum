# Order of operations

---
## Content

Here's one thing useful application from that Math class a long time ago!

In spreadsheets, all calculations follow the `PEMDAS` or `BOMDAS` order of operations.

`PEMDAS` and `BOMDAS` mean the same thing; the former is American and latter is British.

`PEMDAS` stands for:
Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

`BOMDAS` stands for:
Brackets, Orders, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

In Spreadsheets, when you calculate any cell or multiple cells, the calculations are done in the order of operation above.

First, all the parentheses are resolved; next, all exponents; then all the multiplications and divisions (from left to right, whichever comes first); and finally, addition and subtraction (also, left to right).

So, an expression like this one:

```plain-text
3 + 5 ^ (5 - 3) * 4 / 2
```
Would be calculated like this:

```plain-text
1st step, Parentheses:
3 + 5 ^ 2 * 4 / 2
2nd step, Exponents:
3 + 25 * 4 / 2
3rd step, Multiplication and Division:
3 + 100 / 2
4th step, the same since we still have one division:
3 + 50
5th step, Addition and Subtraction:
53
```

Example in spreadsheets:

To remember it more easily you can assign letters in the PEMDAS acronym to spell out a sentence. A common one is "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally".

## Practice

What operation comes after exponents, and before subtraction?

???

* Multiplication
* Parentheses
* No operations do
