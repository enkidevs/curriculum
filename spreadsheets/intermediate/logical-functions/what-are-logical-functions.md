# What are logical functions

## Content

Logical functions are used to get logical results. I.e. results that evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on a condition. 

Logical functions are also sometimes referred to as Boolean functions because they have a boolean result.

There are several logical functions you can use in Spreadsheets.

However, in this workout, we will only discuss the highlighted ones.
