# Editing cells

---
## Content

Editing an empty cell is as simple as clicking on it and typing.

However, if you have a populated cell that you want to edit, just clicking on it once and starting to type deletes everything in the cell and replaces it with the newly typed content.

Example:

As you can see above, when we click on the cell we can see its content in the `formula bar`[1].

There are 3 ways to edit a cell without replacing all of its content:

- Double click the cell.
- Select the cell and press the `F2` shortcut to open the `formula bar`.
- Select the cell and navigate to the `formula bar`.

## Practice

What happens if you click once on a populated cell and start writing?

???

* The content of the cell is replaced with what you write
* What you write is added to the end of the content of the cell

## Footnotes

[1:Formula bar]
The formula bar is where you can see the contents of a cell, and make any changes. What you see in the formula bar might not be what is displayed in the cell.

For instance, if you had the formula `=SUM(A1:B1)` in the cell `C1`, the formula bar would show the formula `=SUM(A1:B1)` while the cell the formula is located in would give you the result of the function.
