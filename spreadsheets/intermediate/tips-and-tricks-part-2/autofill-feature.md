# `Autofill`


---

## Content

The `Autofill` feature is one of spreadsheets' many powerful features.

You can use the `Autofill` to quickly populate cells.

Let's say you had `1` in cell `A1` and `3` in cell `A2`.

You can select both of those cells, click on the small square located at the bottom right of a selected cell and drag in any direction to create a series from those 2 inputs.

So if you had 1 and 3, the next cell would be 5, then 7, 9, 11, etc.

This works for all types of cells.

If we had dates in place of numbers, we would create a series of dates.

If we had functions, we would create functions, etc.

The `Autofill` feature can also be used for single-cell copying.

When we select only a single cell to use with `Autofill` the contents of that cell are copied as-is to the selected ones.

However, when we use functions it operates a bit differently.

As you can see, copying functions with `Autofill` doesn't just copy the same cells that the original function had, it also changes the range of cells to fit the accompanying functions accordingly.
