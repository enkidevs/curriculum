# Cells (Find and Replace)

---
## Content

Cells are essentially where all of your data goes. This means that finding and replacing mistakes should be easy.

Most spreadsheets have a feature to **find and replace data**. To access this in Google Sheets, you go to the `Edit` tab and select `Find and replace`. You can use this feature to find and replace information anywhere in the workbook (all sheets included).

Another quick way of accessing `Find and replace` is by using a keyboard shortcut. In Windows, you would have to press `CTRL + H` while in Mac OS you would have to press `COMMAND + SHIFT + H`.

### Using `Find and replace`

The `Search` tab has a drop-down menu with four checkboxes. In here you can select to search `All sheets`, `This sheet` or a `Specific range` of cells.

The 4 different checkboxes do the following:
- `Match case` is used to specifically match the upper or lowercase of the value being searched for. For example, searching for `"ABC"` with this box checked will not find `"abc"`.
- `Match entire cell contents` is used to find exactly what was inputted. For instance, searching for a cell with `100` won't find any cell that contains `1000`.
- `Search using regular expressions` is used for searching with regular expressions (will be discussed later on)
- `Also search within formulas` is used to search inside formulas (will be discussed in the `Formulas` mission)
