# Cells


---

## Content

A *cell* is *the intersection point of a row and a column*. Since each row has a number, and each column has a letter, each cell corresponds to a letter-number combination. This combination is called a cell's `address`.

For example, a cell in column `C` and row `20` has the address `C20`.

Cells are essentially **storage units that can contain numbers, text, formulas, dates, and more**.

There are four types of cells:

1. Numbers (Formulas, Dates and Times)
2. Strings
3. Boolean
4. Error()

Each cell can be a different size and can be formatted independently.

When a new sheet is created, all cells have equal sizes. They can be resized at any time.

For instance, if a cell contains a date, it can have different formatting like in the example below:
