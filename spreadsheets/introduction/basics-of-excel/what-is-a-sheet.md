## Content

A *sheet (or a worksheet)* is a *single page of a workbook/spreadsheet/folder*.

It consists of rows (usually marked with numbers) and columns (usually marked with letters).

The maximum number of rows, columns, and cells a sheet can have depends on the spreadsheet tool you're using.

For example, in Google Sheets you can have **a maximum of 500,000 rows, 18,278 columns or 5,000,000 cells**. As soon as the cell count reaches 5 million, you can't make any more new rows or columns.

To add a new sheet, go to the bottom left corner of the spreadsheet and press the `+` sign.

Right-clicking on a sheet opens a menu where you can rename it, move it, duplicate it, delete it and more.
