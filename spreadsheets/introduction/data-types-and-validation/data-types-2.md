# Data Types II

---
## Content

Now, let's take a look at the other data types.

### Text

This data type contains numbers but also letters, symbols, spaces, and tabs.

For instance, if you have `00123` in a cell that treats its input as a `Number`, it will save it as `123`. Whereas if you have a `Text` data type, it will save it as `'00123'`.

This is because, in number format, any 0 before a number doesn't change the value of that number (`01 = 0001 = 1`). In `Text` format, each character is part of a string and the whole input is saved.

### Logical

This data type can only take the two values of a boolean: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

They are usually presented as a result of a function. We'll discuss these in the `Functions` mission.

### Errors

`Errors` are usually displayed when there is a problem with a function or formula.

For instance, if you try to divide a number by `0` you'll get the `#DIV/0!` message.

Here's a list of possible errors:
