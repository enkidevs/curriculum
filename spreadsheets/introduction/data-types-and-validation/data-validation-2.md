# Data Validation Example

## Content

Now that you know what data validation is, let's take a look at an example.

We're going to use the `Date` validation for our example, which will give us these options:

Next, we're going to use the `between` option, which will give us these two fields to input the desired date:

Let's say we want a date between `1/2000` and `1/2010`.

The `On invalid` radio button is used to determine if we should reject the input or just show a warning that the input is wrong.

The `Appearance` checkbox is used to give a hint regarding the validation required. If the box is checked, the message is auto-generated depending on the validation set.

Now we're going to write `Input a date between 1/2000 and 1/2010:` in a cell left of `D11` so that users what to input.

With our data validation done, this is what our cell looks like when we hover over it:

And this is how it looks when there is a wrong input:
