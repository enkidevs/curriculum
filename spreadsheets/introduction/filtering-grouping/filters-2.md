# Filters Example

---
## Content

Now that we know how to create a filter, let's add a filter that only displays people who are older than `40`, in `ascending` order.

When you create a filter, it's blank at the start. You need to select how you want to filter your data.

Press on the three green lines highlighted below:

This will open a popup window:

![conditions](https://img.enkipro.com/3e47d81491c9596077d5f7d5adcbcc7e.png)

In the `Filter by condition` section, select `Greater than or equal to` and input `40` into the field below.

The table will now look like this:
