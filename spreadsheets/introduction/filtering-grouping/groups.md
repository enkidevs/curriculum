# Groups


---

## Content

Groups are used to more easily **organize data in a spreadsheet**. If you have a large spreadsheet, you can use groups to easily hide and display parts of your sheet. Both rows and columns can be grouped.

Let's use the same spreadsheet from the previous insight:

Grouping rows and columns is similar to filtering. You select the rows/columns you want to group and go to `Data` and select `Group`. This will open a popup window asking how you want to group.

Using the table above, we're going to select everyone whose profession is a `Police Officer` and create a new group.

This will give us this popup window:

![popup-window](https://img.enkipro.com/3a1269c9a8397eb831fa55906158b17a.png)

Where we are going to select `Group rows 2-4`.

This will give us a checkbox where we can select to either display or hide the grouped cells.

We can also group the `Professor` and `Student` cells and then nest all 3 in a top-level group. This will allow us to easily hide the whole table or just parts of it.
