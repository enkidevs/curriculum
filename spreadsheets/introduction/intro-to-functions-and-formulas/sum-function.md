# The `SUM` Function


---

## Content

The `SUM` function is used to add all values/cells specified in its argument.

Let's say we have a table where we enter money saved for each month every year:

You can apply the `SUM` function in two ways:

- type in `=SUM(C6:C17)`
- type in `=SUM()`, and with the cursor between the parentheses click and drag from `C6` to `C17`

After typing in your formula and hitting enter, your cell displays the result of the `SUM` function.

As you can see, the highlighted `C18` cell displays the result. To check what function is applied to a cell, you can look at the top left side of the sheet.

## Practice

Create a function that will sum up all the values from cell `K63` to `K88`.

???

- `=SUM(K63:K88)`
- `=SUM(K63-K88)`
- `SUM(K63:K88)`
- `SUM(K63-K88)`
