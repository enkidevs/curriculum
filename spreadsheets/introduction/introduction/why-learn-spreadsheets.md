## Content

The main reason to become a spreadsheets pro is that it will **save you a lot of time**, and **increase your value in the modern-day workforce**.

That's because they're used regularly by *pretty much everybody* at work. 

Sales, marketing, operations, analysis and finance teams use spreadsheets on a daily basis. Product, development and management use them on a weekly basis at least.

It's also useful for *personal projects*. Whether you want to record your grades, calculate income and expenditure, or just keep track of and analyze any data, spreadsheets are the way to go.
