If you want to get started quickly, you can always use one of the templates that are available in Google Sheets.

### Invoice

An invoice is a document issued by a seller to a buyer. It provides details about a sale or products, including the quantities, costs, and any special terms.

The invoice template looks something like this:

This template can save you a lot of time if you send invoices regularly.

Instead of creating one from scratch, you can choose the one above, and start filling in the cells. All the necessary calculations and formatting have already been done for you.

### Expense Report

The Expense report can be used by employees to itemize the expenditures for which they want to be reimbursed.

Using this template can save you a couple of hours when creating something like this from scratch.

This template already has predefined areas and formulas that calculate everything instantly. All you have to do is input the numbers and send the document.
