# The Chart Editor

---
## Content

Let's take a look at how you can further customize your charts.
 
We're going to use the chart from the previous workout[1].

In the `Chart editor`, we have a `Customize` tab.

> ⚠️ The `Customize` tab is different for each chart type.

Here you can choose to change:
- the styling
- the axes
- series
- and many more...
 
Let's make the lines smooth for our chart. This is done from the `Chart style` tab:

Other options in this tab include:
- maximizing the chart
- background color
- fonts
- border color
- plot null values

Modifying the titles (and their format) is done in the `Chart & axis titles` tab.

Let's make the title bold and add a subtitle:
