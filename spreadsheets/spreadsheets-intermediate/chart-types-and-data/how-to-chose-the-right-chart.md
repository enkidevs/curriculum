# Choosing the Right Chart
 
---
## Content

When choosing the right chart, there are several things you have to keep in mind:
- the amount of data you want to use for the chart
- what the chart is about
- do you want to show a change over time
- summarize things
- how you want to scale
- and many more...

Each chart type is used for a particular type of data.

### Pie Charts

They are best used when you want to compare parts of a whole.

### Line Charts

They are best used to display a change over time. 

You could check if your company's profit is going up or down based on two or more entries.

To determine what chart you need, you first need to look at your data.

When in doubt, you can always test all the charts and decide on the one that best suits you.
