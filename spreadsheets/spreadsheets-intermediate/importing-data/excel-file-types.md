# Excel File Types

---
## Content

Before we find out how to import a file, let's see which file types you can import.

These files are commonly created when you save your spreadsheet. They usually start with `.xl` followed by one or two characters. 

The default file type when saving a spreadsheet is `.xlsx`. 

> 💡 If you're using a version of Excel that is older than 2007 then the file type would be `.xls`.

If your spreadsheet contains a macro, then it would have the `.xlsm` type.

Templates can have two file types, `.xltx` and `.xltm`. The only difference between the two is that `.xltm` can store macros.

> 💡 On Excel versions that are older than 2003, the basic template format is `.xlt`.

If you're using **OpenOffice**, then the default file type is `.ods`.
