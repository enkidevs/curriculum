# Populating Your Pivot Table
 

---

## Content

Let's see how you can populate your pivot table!

Looking at the `Pivot table editor` on the right-hand side[1], you can notice a bunch of options.

Usually, Sheets will analyze the data and create a few suggestions based on that.

> üí° If the suggestion fits your requirements, it's best to select it since it will save time.

For exercise purposes, we won't be selecting one of the suggested options.

To manually create your pivot table, you need to add rows and columns.

To do this, click `Add` next to the field followed by choosing the data.

> üí° `Rows` and `Columns` fields are used to display unique values from our source table.

> üí° Because the data is unique, you cannot have the same data in both the `Rows` and `Columns` fields.

As soon as you add it, it will be visible in the pivot table.

Let's add `Category` and `Product` as rows.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The order of the data in the `Rows` and `Columns` section is important.

Pivot tables will group data based on the topmost data set in the editor.

You can switch the order of the data by dragging it.

In the same manner, you can add columns.
