# Find and Replace Example


---

## Content

Let's say we have a table that contains only this column:

| Column |
| :----: |
|   77   |
|   88   |
|   77   |
|   88   |
|   77   |
|   88   |
|   77   |
|   88   |
|   77   |
|   88   |

We can use the `Find and replace` feature to replace the first instance of `77` with `100`, like so:

![find-and-replace-one](https://img.enkipro.com/5b9745748cd7f1708f56addd76d7a4e4.png)

As you can see, you get a small message saying what was replaced.

You can also use the `Replace all` button to change all instances of `88` to `A`:

![find-and-replace-all](https://img.enkipro.com/51e09ad5093527daf14f2834b3e2b322.png)

> 💡 When you press `Replace all` you get a popup window asking you to confirm your decision. This is because some replacements could end up changing a big part of your data, which isn't always desirable or intended.
