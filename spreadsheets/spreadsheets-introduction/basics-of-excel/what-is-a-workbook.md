## Content

Most of you will be familiar with lots of the content in this workout. If you skim through, we've **boldened** the most interesting stuff!

A workbook is a single file containing one or more worksheets. You start with one worksheet when you create a new workbook. More sheets can be added at any time.

The main difference between a workbook and a worksheet is that **you can have many worksheets inside a single workbook, but not vice versa**. The workbook is the main 'folder' and it can contain as many worksheets as needed.

A worksheet is just a grid-like table, made of rows and columns.

To create a new workbook in Microsoft Excel go to `File` then select `New` followed by `Blank Workbook`.

In Google Sheets, the only difference is that instead of `Blank Workbook` you select `Spreadsheet`.

In summary, the process is `File > New > Blank Workbook/Spreadsheet`

The maximum worksheets a workbook can have depends on the tool you are using and the memory of your computer.
