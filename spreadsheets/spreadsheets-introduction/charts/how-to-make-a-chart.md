## Content

To create a chart, first, you need to create a table.

For this example we'll use the following data:

Now, select the whole table, go to `Insert` and select `Chart`.

This will give you a suggested chart for your data and an options tab where you can choose to modify your chart.

After you click on a different chart or change something in the data table, the chart instantly updates.
