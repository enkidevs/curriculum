# Types of Charts I

## Content

There are a variety of charts you can make, with some of the more well known ones being `Pie`, `Bar` and `Column` charts.

Consider the following data:

Let's use this to create three different charts.

### Pie Chart

The pie chart is circular and sliced into sections just like a pie. The whole pie represents 100% and each section is a percentage of the whole pie.

The example chart shows the total number of users for the first 10 days of December for a certain app.

### Bar Chart

The bar chart is used to represent data with either horizontal or vertical bars.

### Column Chart

The column charts are used to horizontally represent data with vertical bars.
