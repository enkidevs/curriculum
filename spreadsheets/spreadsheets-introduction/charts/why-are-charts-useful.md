# Why Are Charts Useful?


---

## Content

Charts are very useful to help **understand large quantities of data** that would otherwise be difficult to individually analyze. You can represent thousands of data points in a chart.

Another good example is detecting patterns and understanding results in a more clear way.

Depending on the type of chart you choose, you can "tell a different story". This is because visualizations can quickly demonstrate patterns, allow us to draw conclusions, and determine any negative or positive outcomes about our data.
