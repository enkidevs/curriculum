# Data Validation


---

## Content

With spreadsheets, you might want to limit the type of data that can be inserted in a cell. This can be achieved by using data validation.

For instance, you can make a cell be of type `date` and only allow actual date input. You can even restrict the data further and only accept a date `after`, `before` or `between`.

To open `Data validation`, you can go to `Data` in the toolbar:

Another option is right-clicking any cell and selecting `Data validation` at the bottom.

This will give you a popup window like so:

To select a cell click on `Cell range` followed by clicking (or clicking and dragging) on the cells of interest.

Under `Criteria` there are several options you can choose from:

Depending on your selection, a different subset of options that will appear on the right side[1].

To remove a data validation, all you have to do is right-click the cell you want to remove the validation, open `data validation` and click `remove validation`.

## Practice

`Data Validation` is ???

- a feature used to constrain a particular input into a cell.
- an external program used to create valid data.
- just another name for analysis.
- a feature used to separate different dates and validate them separately.
