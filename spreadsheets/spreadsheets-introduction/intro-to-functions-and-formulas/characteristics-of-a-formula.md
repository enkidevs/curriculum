# Characteristics of a Formula


---

## Content

Formulas always start with an equals sign (`=`).

Formulas can use **any cell and any data type**. Formulas can also reference cells in other sheets (within the same spreadsheet).

For instance, `=(B3+7*2)/C4` is a valid formula that references values from `B3` and `C4` along with some numbers.

However, if `B3` (or `C4`) was not a number, we would get this error: `#VALUE!`.
Hovering over this gives us this explanation:

```plain-text
Error
Function ADD parameter 1 expects number values. But 'z' is a text and cannot be coerced to a number.
```

## Practice

What is the main characteristic of any formula?

???

- `It has to start with a =`
- `It cannot start with a =`
- `It has to end with a $`
- `It cannot end with a $`
