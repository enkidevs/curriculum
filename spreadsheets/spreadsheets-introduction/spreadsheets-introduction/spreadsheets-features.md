# Spreadsheet Features I


---

## Content

Spreadsheets were designed to work with numerical data. You can perform both simple calculations like multiplication, or complex ones which include *multiple functions* at the same time.

There are many *formulas* that can be used to organize, calculate, or find the data that you need. You can even set up formulas to change the color of certain cells based on calculations or conditions.
