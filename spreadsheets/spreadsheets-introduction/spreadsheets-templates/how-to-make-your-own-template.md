# Making Your Own Templates


---

## Content

Now that we know how to use predefined templates, it's time to learn how to make your own. In this insight, we'll discuss creating your own template in Google Sheets.

One thing to note when creating your own template in Google Sheets is that there are public and private templates. Anyone can use and see any updates you make to a public template. For private ones, only you can see and use it.

### Creating a Private Template

Start off by preparing your spreadsheet. When you have finished with your set-up (formatting & formulas), save the spreadsheet with an appropriate name (such as `My Schedule Template`). Now, every time you want to use it you have to make a copy and get started.

Making a copy is done by right-clicking the spreadsheet in question and selecting the `Make a copy` option.

### Creating a Public Template

Creating a public template is a bit different. After setting up your spreadsheet, you need to go to `File` and select `Publish to web`.

This will open a new tab called `Publish to the web` where you can choose how to publish your template.

When publishing, you can choose to either:

- publish the `Entire Document`
- pick certain sheets and publish them (using whatever file type you choose)

After you press publish, you will get a link to the newly published template that you and anyone else can have access to.
