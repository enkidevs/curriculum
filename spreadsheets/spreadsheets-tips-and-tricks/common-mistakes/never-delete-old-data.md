# Never Destroy Old Data


---

## Content

Sometimes, when you have a complex spreadsheet, you don't want to spend time creating it again so you overwrite the old cell data with the new data. 

This is bad practice, because saving data can help you compare it and find any mistakes, compare changes in outcomes, and many more things, depending on what your spreadsheet is for.

After all, if the data was worth creating a spreadsheet for, it might be worth saving it for future use as well.

You can avoid this problem in two ways:

1. Create a template from an already made spreadsheet and use that template for any future work. This way you'll save all old data as well as have the new one.

2. Select the whole sheet, copy it, and paste it in a new sheet, where you can make your changes.
