# Spreadsheet Shortcuts

---

## Content

In this workout, we will go over the best shortcuts that you can use later. Feel free to bookmark the ones you find most useful!

This workout will serve as a "Cheatsheet" you can use when working with Google Sheets.

The shortcuts are structured like this:

```plain-text
Windows shortcuts - macOS shortcuts

Description

Image (If applicable)

If we give only one shortcut version that means it's the same shortcut on both operating systems.
```
