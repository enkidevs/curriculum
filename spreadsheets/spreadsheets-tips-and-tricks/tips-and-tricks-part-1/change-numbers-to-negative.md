## Content

Imagine you have a large table, and you want to make a portion of the numbers negative.

Here's the table:

Let's say that we want to make the whole 2nd column of numbers negative.

To do this, we can:

1. select the cells we want to change, 
2. press the shortcut `ctrl` + `h`, or navigate to the `Find and Replace` tool, 
3. enter `^` in the `Find` field, and `-` in the `Replace` field, 
4. tick the `Search using regular expressions` field and press the `Replace all`.
