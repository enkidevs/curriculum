# Find and Select Functions Faster


---

## Content

When adding a function to a cell, you don't need to type the full name of the function to select it.

You can type the equals sign followed by a few letters until you see the function you need.

When selecting a function, you can use the arrow keys to select different options from the drop-down menu and press tab or enter on the highlighted one to select it.

Example:

> 💡 Even though functions are all uppercase, when finding/selecting one, you don't need to use uppercase letters.
