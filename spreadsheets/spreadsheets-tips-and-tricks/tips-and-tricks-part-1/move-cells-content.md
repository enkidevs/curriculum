# Transfer Cells to Different Locations


---

## Content

There are two ways to transfer contents of a single cell or a range of cells to a different location in the spreadsheet.

**Notes:**

- Moving contents of one or multiple cells is the same, so we'll only show moving multiple
- The way they are pasted is always the same as how they looked when they were copied
- Functions are also copied.

## Method 1

Select all the cells you want to transfer to a different location.

On Windows, press `ctrl` + `x` to cut, and `ctrl` + `v` paste.

On a Mac, press `command` + `x` to cut, and `command` + `v` to paste.

Example table:

Let's say we want to move all the cells from this table to a different location.

We can do so like this:

## Method 2

Select all the cells you want to move, hold `ctrl` on Windows, or `command` on a Mac, and click on any side of the cells you have selected and drag them to the new location.
