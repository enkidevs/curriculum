# The Functions Menu


---

## Content

Instead of typing the equals sign and the function name every time you want to add a new function, you can just select one from the `functions` button.

When pressed, the `functions` button opens a drop-down menu with all available functions split into several categories.

The `functions` button is located on the far right of the `toolbar`. (highlighted in green)
