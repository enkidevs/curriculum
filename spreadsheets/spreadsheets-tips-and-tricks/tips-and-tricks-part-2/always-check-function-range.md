# Always Check Your Function Range

---

## Content

Functions in spreadsheets are a powerful feature, however, it's easy to make mistakes in calculations by not selecting a few necessary cells.

Luckily, double-clicking a cell with a function in it will highlight all the cells that are used by that function.

The orange rectangle represents the range of cells we have selected with `shift` and is shown as `B2:D6` in the function bar. 

The `B8` and `B9` cells are separated with a comma because they were not included in the range and were single separate selections using `ctrl`.

> 💡 The colors used to display the ranges and individually selected cells may vary, but the process to select/deselect the cells is the same for everyone.
