# Version History


---

## Content

Google Sheets allow users to save and create different versions of their work.

The versions are autosaved after every few changes, however, you can also manually save versions of your spreadsheets and also give those versions a name.

### Save a version

To manually save a version of your spreadsheet, go to `File` -> `Version history` -> `Name current version`.

After you select `Name current version`, a new pop-up window will appear asking you to enter the name of the version.

Enter the name you want, i.e. "First Version" and save.

### Revert to a previous version

To revert back to a version of your document, go to `File` -> `Version history` -> `See version history`.

A new popup window will appear with a `Version history` panel on the right and the spreadsheet preview on the left. By selecting the version on the `Version history` panel you can see what was changed in the spreadsheet panel on the left. 

`Version history` pannel:

On this panel, you can also deselect the auto-selected `Show changes` checkbox if you don't want to look at the changes or you can only display the versions you have manually created and named using the `Only show named versions` button.

To restore to a previous version, select the version you like and click the green `Restore this version` button located at the top left of the `See version history` panel.
