# Using Shortcuts to Select Cells


---

## Content

When selecting a cell or range of cells, whether it's for a function or just when selecting, you can use different shortcuts to save time.

For instance, you can select a range of cells by clicking on one and holding `shift` while selecting a different one and all the cells between those 2 will also be selected. 

You can select a range vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.

When selecting diagonally you will also select the horizontal and vertical cells leading up to that diagonal one.

Example with `shift + click`:

You can also use `ctrl + click` to select different cells individually:

Or you can also use the combination of both to more precisely select all the cells you want.

**Note:** When using `ctrl` to select cells, be careful not to select the same cell more than one time. Doing this will not cause the function to create an error, but it may lead to having wrong calculations for your functions.
