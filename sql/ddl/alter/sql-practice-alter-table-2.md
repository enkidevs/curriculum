# SQL Practice Aggregate Average


---

## Exercise

We've added a authentication method to our webapp! Now we need *you* to update the database.
We've allowed users to use their Twitter ID instead of their Facebook ID to log on.
*However*, we only accept Facebook *OR* Twitter... Not both. For reasons.

First, update the name of the `facebook_id` column to reflect that you can use either ID. Change it to `social_id`.

Once that's done, we'll also need a new column that indicates whether they used Facebook or Twitter. Create a new column called `social_type` and set all current values to `facebook`.
Set the default value for this new column to be `facebook`. For reasons.
