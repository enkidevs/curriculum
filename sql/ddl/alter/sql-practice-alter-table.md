# SQL Practice Aggregate Average


---

## Exercise

Click *Launch Exercise* to launch SQLFiddle. Examine the `CREATE` statements in the lefthand window.

Consider the `item_pictures` table. It turns out the maxiumum length of the `URL` field is much too short to hold mosts urls. Unfortunately, the schema is *already in production*, so re-creating the database is not an option.

Write a statement to modify the `item_pictures`, changing the maximum length of the `URL` field 100 to 250 characters. 

*Note:* Don't directly edit the `CREATE` statements; instead, write a new statement to alter the table.

To submit, run your SQL and then add the link from SQLFiddle to your submission.
