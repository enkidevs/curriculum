# SQL Practice Aggregate Average


---

## Exercise

In this SQLFiddle, we need to alter the `items` table.

By default, the `id` field of every entry in this table will increment by 1. Instead, we need the `id` field to increment by *100*. 

*Create an `ALTER TABLE` statement to satisfy this condition*.

Note: When submitting, include the output of the provided query as your answer.
