# SQL Practice Aggregate Average


---

## Exercise

Our database has no default values in it! If someone messes up a query, things could get weird...
Fix all of the errors by creating defaults.

In order to do this properly, you will need to satisfy the following conditions:

* *ID fields should autoincrement*
* *The `email_verified` and `accepted` fields should default to `false`*
* *The `daily_price` field should default to `0`*

After that is done, the seed script should run properly.
