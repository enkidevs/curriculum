# Create a Database


---

## Content

We will create a PostgreSQL database. Using the terminal we need to enter the following command:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE my_first_db;
```

This command creates a new database called *"my_first_db"*.

Note that PostgresSQL provides users with a command line executable for creating a database. Using:

```bash
createdb [options...] [dbname][description]
```

Parameters:

* `options` command-line arguments, that the db accepts
* `dbname` database name
* `description` optional initial comment that can be added

The `createdb` command is a wrapper around the transact SQL query `CREATE DATABASE`. The only difference is that the former can be run from the command line and it enables users to add a initial comment in the db.
