# SQL Practice Define Relationships


---

## Exercise

Click *Launch Exercise* to launch SQLFiddle.
Add Foreign Key constraints to the `user_items` and `requests` tables where appropriate.

**Hint:** According to SQL naming convention, if a column has `id` as *part* of its name, it communicates to other developers that is a foreign key.
