While vendors' default character encoding might not be `UTF-8`, there are some ways in which it can be set.

PostgreSQL accepts database-wide encoding which translates to `UTF8` encoding for all tables:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE application
WITH ENCODING 'UTF8'
LC_COLLATE='en_US.UTF-8'
LC_CTYPE='en_US.UTF-8';
```

MySQL's `utf8` encoding maps to a subset of the `UTF-8` characters (characters that can be stored in maximum 3 bytes). To include support for the missing characters, use `utf8mb`:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE application
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
```

Microsoft SQL has special string data types that use `UTF-8` encoding by default. They are referenced by adding the `n` prefix to the basic string data types:
- `nchar(n)`
- `nvarchar(n)`
