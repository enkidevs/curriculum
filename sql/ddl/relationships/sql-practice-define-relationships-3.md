## Exercise

Define an one to one relationship using foreign key constraints between `items` and `item_pictures` tables.
In order to check your results, write the query for the relationship and `build schema` again. After that run the query provided and answer with the value in `REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA` column of the result.
