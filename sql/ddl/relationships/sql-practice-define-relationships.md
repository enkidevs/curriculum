## Exercise

Define a foreign key constraint to obtain a one to many relationship between `user` and `items` tables.
In order to check your results, write the query for the relationship and `build schema` again. After that run the query provided and answer with the value in `REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA` column of the result.
