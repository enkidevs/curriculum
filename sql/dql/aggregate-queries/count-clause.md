## Content

The `COUNT` clause returns the total number of entries in a given column.

Using `COUNT` function[1]:

```
SELECT COUNT(experience) AS count
FROM experience 
LIMIT 5;


--Result:
  count
=========
    5
(1 row)
```
No matter how many entries there are in the `experience` table, we limit the output to 5 rows. Hence, the result is *5*.

## Practice

We have a table "location". It has data stating the region each location belongs to. How many locations are there in each region? Display the result ordered by regions.
```
-- location
id  | region_id |      name           
====+===========+===============
  1 |         4 | canalave-city
  2 |         4 | eterna-city
  3 |         4 | pastoria-city
...

SELECT ???(name),???
FROM location
??? region_id
ORDER BY region_id;

--Result:
count | region_id
======+===========
   90 |         1
   64 |         2
   82 |         3
  126 |         4
  121 |         5
  104 |         6
   91 |          
(7 rows)


```

* COUNT
* region_id
* GROUP BY
* ORDER BY
* SUM
* AVG

## Revision

Knowing that the pokemon db has a table called `item` and a field `name`, count all name entries?
```
    ???
--Result:
  count
=========
   746
(1 row)

```

* SELECT COUNT(name) FROM item;
* SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM item;
* SELECT COUNT(item) FROM name;
* SELECT COUNT(name) FROM item

## Footnotes

[1:Pokemon Db]
We will use the same segment of "experience" table for all aggregate functions:
```
-- experience table:

id  | level | experience | growth_rate_id
====+=======+============+===============
  1 |     1 |          0 |              1
  2 |     2 |         10 |              1
  3 |     3 |         33 |              1
....

SELECT experience
FROM experience
LIMIT 5;

--Result:
experience
============
     0
    10
    33
    80
   156
 (5 rows)

```
