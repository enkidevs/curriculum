# Group By clause

---
## Content

The `GROUP BY` clause is often used with aggregate functions (e.g. `SUM`, `AVG`). Syntactically it comes after the `WHERE` clause and before the `ORDER BY` in the *query*. It enables users to group data by one or more columns.

In our Pokemon db, we have a table called `move_name` with the following columns:
- `id` - unique move name id
- `language_id` - id of the language name is spelled in
- `move_id`
- `name` - how each move is called in each language

`GROUP BY` will help us count how many `move_names` there are for each language:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), language_id
FROM move_name
GROUP BY language_id;
```

Output:

| count | language_id |
|-------|-------------|
| 639   | 6           |
| 639   | 5           |
| 639   | 8           |
| 639   | 1           |
| 639   | 9           |
| 617   | 3           |
| 639   | 7           |

## Practice

We have a table called `pokemon`. In this table there are two fields:
1. `is_default` - Boolean
2. `name` - String (name of the pokemon)

We want to count how many pokemon are **not** default. Fill in the blanks to complete this query:
```sql
SELECT ???(name),???
FROM pokemon
??? is_default;
```

Output:

| count | is_default |
|-------|------------|
| 90    | f          |
| 721   | t          |

* COUNT
* is_default
* GROUP BY
* AVG
* SUM
* name

## Revision

`item` is a table with the following columns:  
`id` - unique id of the item  
`cost` - item's cost  
`item_category_id` - ID category  
`name` - item's name  

Find the _average cost of items in each category_.

```sql
SELECT ???(cost),item_category_id
FROM ???
??? item_category_id
ORDER BY item_category_id;
```

Output:

| avg    | item_category_id |
|--------|------------------|
| 550    | 1                |
| 20     | 2                |
| 20     | 3                |
| 12     | 4                |
| 20     | 5                |
| 20     | 6                |
| 18.88  | 7                |
| 20     | 8                |
| 134.28 | 9                |
| 1810   | 10               |
| ...    | ...              |

* AVG
* item
* GROUP BY
* SUM
* ORDER BY
* GROUP
