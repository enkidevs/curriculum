# SUM clause


---

## Content

The `SUM` clause comes in handy when we need to perform numerical addition.

Below we will see some examples based on a hypothetical database containing important information on pokemon. First, we will extract a limited number of entries[1]&#x3A;

```bash
-- table called `experience_table`
id  | level | experience | growth_rate_id
====+=======+============+===============
  1 |     1 |          0 |              1
  2 |     2 |         10 |              1
  3 |     3 |         33 |              1
....
```

```sql
SELECT experience
FROM experience_table
LIMIT 5;

--Result:
experience
============
     0
    10
    33
    80
   156
 (5 rows)
```

We can use the `SUM` function to quickly add up all the totals above[2]&#x3A;

```sql
SELECT SUM(experience) FROM
(SELECT experience
  FROM experience_table
  LIMIT 5);
```

*Result:*

```bash
  sum
=======
  279
(1 row)
```

## Practice

Considering the `move_effect_change` table. We want to know the total amount of move_effect:

```bash
-- "move_effect_change"
id | move_effect | version_group_id
===+=============+==================
 1 |           8 |               11
 2 |          18 |                3
 3 |          29 |                3

--Result:
======
3884
(1 row)
```

Construct a query to do so:

```sql
SELECT ???(???) FROM move_effect_change;
```

* SUM
* move_effect
* AVG
* total
* TOTAL
* ADD

## Revision

We have a table called `items` that contains the name and cost of every item in Pokeland. We want to know how much it would cost to buy all items...

```bash
--items:

id  | cost  |    name       
=====+======+============
  1 |     0 | master-ball
  2 |  1200 | ultra-ball
  3 |   600 | great-ball
  4 |   200 | poke-ball

--Result:   
========
 728060
(1 row)
```

Which query will do so?

???

* SELECT SUM(cost) FROM item;
* SELECT AVG(cost) FROM item;
* SELECT MAX(cost) FROM item;

## Footnotes

[1:LIMIT]
`LIMIT` number.
This clause enables users to `SELECT` the first given number of entries

[2:Nested Query]
We need to use nested queries to be able to `SELECT SUM()` only on the first 5 entries.
In this particular case we say: Compute the `SUM` on the experience column, taking into acount only the 5 entries of the table. `AS` must be specifiend when using nested queries.
You can find out more about nested quries here: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-sub-queries.htm>
