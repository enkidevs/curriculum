## Content

To get all of the data from a table, you can use a `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon;
```

The above command gets all of the *columns* and all of the *rows* from the `pokemon` table.

We can also use the `SELECT` statement to specify the exact *columns* we want to keep from the table, and to discard the others.

```sql
SELECT id, weight, name
FROM pokemon;
```

The above command gets only the `id`, `weight`, and `name` columns from the table, but keeps all of the rows of the `pokemon` table. Remember, the information is not deleted, you're simply **querying** the database, but doing so in a way where you only receive the information contained in the specified columns.

## Quiz

headline: What statement gets columns and rows from tables?

question: |

  Given a table called `ability` from our pokemon database:

  id   | is_main_series | generation_id |      name      
  -----|----------------|---------------|---------------
     1 | t              |             3 | stench
     2 | f              |             3 | drizzle
     3 | t              |             3 | speed-boost
     4 | t              |             3 | battle-armor
  (...)


  Choose the query that will get all the entries from this table:

answers:
  - SELECT * FROM ability;
  - DISPLAY [all] FROM ability;
  - SELECT [all] FROM ability;
