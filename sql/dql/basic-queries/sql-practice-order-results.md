# SQL Practice Order Results


---

## Exercise

In SQLFiddle, write a SQL query that does the following:

*Return the `name` and `fling_power` of all items that cost between `100` and `500`, ordered by the `fling_power`.*

For your answer, write the name of the item with the *least* fling power, followed by the name of the item with the *greatest* fling power within this range.
