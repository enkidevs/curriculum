# WHERE (2)

## Content

### `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

As you have seen in the previous insight, the predicates we use in `WHERE` can be conjoined using logical operators like `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`. These operators are used in combination with filtering conditions (e.g. `salary > 1000`) and can be used for:

- returning records for which two (or more) conditions are true at the same time with `AND`
- returning records for which any of two (or more) conditions are true with `OR`
- negating a condition with `NOT`

They work as you would expect them to; you can include only the rows which satisfy both or either of two conditions using `AND` and `OR`, respectively. `NOT` negates the truth value of the predicate, so it selects the rows that don't satisfy the condition.

Let's take a look at this `pokemon` table:

| id | name    | total | hp | attack | defense |
|----|---------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| 50 | Diglett | 265   | 10 | 55     | 25      |
| 51 | Dugtrio | 425   | 35 | 100    | 50      |
| 52 | Meowth  | 290   | 40 | 45     | 35      |
| 53 | Persian | 440   | 65 | 70     | 60      |
| 54 | Psyduck | 320   | 50 | 52     | 48      |
| 55 | Golduck | 500   | 80 | 82     | 78      |

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE name = 'Meowth'
  OR name = 'Golduck';
```

This shows the rows where the `name` is an exact match of either 'Meowth' or 'Golduck'. The resulting set looks like this:

| id | name    | total | hp | attack | defense |
|----|---------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| 52 | Meowth  | 290   | 40 | 45     | 35      |
| 55 | Golduck | 500   | 80 | 82     | 78      |

In the previous insight we have used the `<>` comparison operator to check if the `name` was not 'Charmander'. The same can be achieved using `!=` or by coupling a comparison operator (`=`) and a logical operation (`NOT`):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE NOT name = 'Charmander';
```

This statement shows all rows **except** for the one where name is equal to 'Charmander'. In our case, this query would return all our records (rows) as we do not have any entries with the `name` 'Charmander'.

You can also use parenthesis to construct complex expressions, like so:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE (name = 'Diglett'
  OR name = 'Dugtrio')
    AND (total > 300 AND total < 500);
```

This query will only return the row with the `name` *Dugtrio* because for the record with the `name` *Diglett* the `total` value is not between 300 and 500.

| id | name    | total | hp | attack | defense |
|----|---------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| 51 | Dugtrio | 425   | 35 | 100    | 50      |

## Practice

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping the rows where the `total` is greater than 350 or `attack` is between 5 and 15.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pokemon
??? (??? 350) ???
  (??? 5 ??? ??? 15); 
```

* `WHERE`
* `total >`
* `OR`
* `attack >`
* `AND`
* `attack <`
* `IS`
* `total GREATER THAN`
* `attack MORE THAN`
* `total MORE THAN`
* `attack GREATER THAN`

## Revision

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping only the rows where the name equals either 'bulbasaur', 'ivysaur' or 'venusaur'.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
??? ???
???
???;
```

* `WHERE`
* `name = 'bulbasaur' OR`
* `name = 'ivysaur' OR`
* `name = 'venusaur'`
* `name IS`
* `OR`
* `name IN`
* `'ivysaur'`
* `'bulbasaur'`
* `'venusaur'`

## Quiz 
### Can you select rows between two values in SQL?
Consider the `move_name` table:

```bash

  id  | language_id | move_id |  name       
======|=============|=========|=============
    1 |           1 |       1 | はたく
    2 |           3 |       1 | 막치기
    3 |           5 |       1 | Écras'Face
    4 |           6 |       1 | Pfund
    5 |           7 |       1 | Destructor
  (...)
```
Choose the query that will get all move names with id between 3 and 6. Also, pay attention to select those name that are used in languages with id 5 or 9:

 ???

* SELECT name FROM move_name WHERE move_id BETWEEN 3 AND 6 AND language_id IN (5,9);
* SELECT * FROM move_name WHERE move_id BETWEEN 3 AND 6 AND language_id IN (5,9);
* SELECT name FROM move_name WHERE move_id >= 3 AND move_id <= 6 AND language_id >= 5 OR language_id <= 9;
* SELECT name FROM move_name WHERE move_id IN (3,6) AND language_id >= 5 AND language_id <= 9;
