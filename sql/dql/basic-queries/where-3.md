### `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`

SQL provides a bunch of special operators to help you write complex querying conditions. More specifically, in this insight, we will take a look at:

- the `LIKE` operator, which is used to define a pattern that the given attribute should conform to
- the `IN` operator, which allows us to define a list of values of which the attribute must be one
- the `BETWEEN` operator, which allows us to define a range of values in which the attribute must be

Let's consider the following `pokemon` table:

| name       | total | hp | attack | defense |
|------------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Bulbasaur  | 318   | 45 | 49     | 49      |
| Ivysaur    | 405   | 60 | 62     | 63      |
| Venusaur   | 525   | 80 | 82     | 83      |
| Charmander | 309   | 39 | 52     | 43      |
| Charmeleon | 405   | 58 | 64     | 58      |
| Charizard  | 534   | 78 | 84     | 78      |
| Squirtle   | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |
| Wartortle  | 405   | 59 | 63     | 80      |
| Blastoise  | 530   | 79 | 83     | 100     |
| Caterpie   | 195   | 45 | 30     | 35      |
| Metapod    | 205   | 50 | 20     | 55      |

The `IN` condition allows you to easily test if a value inside a column matches any one specific item in a list of values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE name IN ('Charmander',
  'Squirtle', 'Bulbasaur');
```

In this case, we will only get the rows of the three starter Pokémon: Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

| name       | total | hp | attack | defense |
|------------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Bulbasaur  | 318   | 45 | 49     | 49      |
| Charmander | 309   | 39 | 52     | 43      |
| Squirtle   | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |

The `LIKE` statement accepts a pattern string, where wildcard characters are used to denote an acceptable pattern.[1]

 - `%` is a **wildcard**. This means it counts for a string of any characters of any length, including nothing.
 - `_` represents only one character.

Therefore, `%le` denotes any string that ends in 'le'. `_le` denotes any string with only one character before 'le'. They can be chained together into complex patterns like `___taco%` which denotes any string containing the substring 'taco' at its 4th position, and with any number of characters after.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE name LIKE '%le';
```

The result of this statement is the two rows of the Pokémon whose names end in 'le': Squirtle and Wartortle.

| name      | total | hp | attack | defense |
|-----------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Squirtle  | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |
| Wartortle | 405   | 59 | 63     | 80      |

You can use the `BETWEEN` operator[2] to define a range of acceptable values, like so:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE attack BETWEEN 60 AND 100;
```

The resulting set will be:

| name       | total | hp | attack | defense |
|------------|-------|----|--------|---------|
| Ivysaur    | 405   | 60 | 62     | 63      |
| Venusaur   | 525   | 80 | 82     | 83      |
| Charmeleon | 405   | 58 | 64     | 58      |
| Charizard  | 534   | 78 | 84     | 78      |
| Wartortle  | 405   | 59 | 63     | 80      |
| Blastoise  | 530   | 79 | 83     | 100     |

## Practice

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping only the rows where the name is one of: 'Groudon', 'Snorlax' or 'Wailord'.

`SELECT * `
`FROM pokemon`
??? ??? ??? ???;


* WHERE
* name
* IN
* ('Groudon', 'Snorlax', 'Wailord')
* SUCH THAT
* IS ONE OF
* ['Groudon', 'Snorlax', 'Wailord']

## Revision

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping only the rows where the name ends with the string 'saur'.

`SELECT * `
`FROM pokemon`
??? ??? ??? ???;


* WHERE
* name
* LIKE
* '%saur'
* NAME IS
* AND
* 'saur'
* 'saur%'

## Quiz 
### Do you know how to match a pattern in SQL?
Consider the `location` table from our pokemon database:


```

id  | region_id |     name           
====|===========|================
  1 |         4 | canalave-city
  2 |         1 | eterna-city
  3 |         3 | pastoria-city
(...)

```

Choose the query that will get all the location records that are based in regions 1, 2. Also, pay attention to include only locations that end in 'city':

 ???

* SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name LIKE '%city';
* SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name='%city';
* SELECT * FROM location WHERE BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND name='%city';
* SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name LIKE '_city';

## Footnotes
[1:RDBMS Implementations]
Note that some databases may have a different implementation of the specific wildcard characters
[2: BETWEEN]
This can be seen as a shortcut for chaining two comparison operators with the `AND` clause:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE col BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
-- is the same as
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE col >= 1 AND
      col <= 10;
```
