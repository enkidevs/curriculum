The `FULL JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN`, is a type of join that combines the functionality of `RIGHT JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`. In other words, it returns matching rows, rows that are only in the left-hand table and rows that are only in the right-hand table.

If we are to fall back to the previous example of *moves* and *types*, the output won't be different:
```SQL
SELECT move.id, move.name,
  type.id, type.name AS type_name
FROM move
FULL OUTER JOIN type ON
move.type_id = type.id;
```
However, if our **type** table had the extra `wood` type and there was an extra `coolest-move-ever` in the **move** table, both values would get printed, on top of the other 640 rows:
```
id  |        name       |   id   | type_name
====+===================+========+==========
1   |        pound      |   1    |  normal
...
1234| coolest-move-ever |  NULL  |   NULL
NULL|        NULL       |   19   |   wood
```

Here's what a FULL JOIN represents:

## Practice

Fill in the gaps such that the following snippet becomes a valid `FULL OUTER JOIN`:
```SQL
??? *
FROM ???
??? berry_firmness ???
berry.berry_firmness_id = berry_firmness.id
WHERE berry_firmness.id = 2???
```
* `SELECT`
* `berry`
* `FULL OUTER JOIN`
* `ON`
* `;`
* `*`

## Revision

The correct syntax for fully joining two tables is:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM pokemon_type
??? type ???
pokemon_type.type_id = type.id
```

* `FULL JOIN`
* `ON`
* `LEFT AND RIGHT JOIN`
* `OUTER JOIN`

## Quiz

headline: Can you select data from two related tables in SQL?

question: |

  Given the tables called `location` and `location_area`:

  id  | region_id |     name           
  ----|-----------|---------------
    1 |         4 | canalave-city
    2 |         4 | eterna-city
    3 |         4 | pastoria-city
  (...)

  id  | game_index | location_id |       name                      
  ----|------------|-------------|--------------------
    1 |          1 |           1 | canalave-city-area
    2 |          2 |           2 | eterna-city-area
    3 |          3 |           3 | pastoria-city-area
    4 |          4 |           4 | sunyshore-city-area
  (...)


  Note that there are 6 regions, but not all locations belong to one of them. Get location id, game index and region id for all records. It doesn't matter whether there is no game index for a region or vice versa. The result should look like this:

  id  | game_index | region_id
  ----|------------|-----------
    1 |          1 |         4
    2 |          2 |         4
    3 |          3 |         4
    (...)
    21|          21|          
    (...)
      |          56|         
    (...)
    89|            |         6


answers:
  - SELECT location.id,location_area.game_index,location.region_id
    FROM location FULL OUTER JOIN location_area
    ON location.id = location_area.id;
  - SELECT location.id,location_area.game_index,location.region_id
    FROM location INNER JOIN location_area
    ON location.id = location_area.id;
  - SELECT location.id,location_area.game_index,location.region_id
    FROM location LEFT JOIN location_area
    ON location.id = location_area.id;
  - SELECT location.id,location_area.game_index,location.region_id
    FROM location RIGHT JOIN location_area
    ON location.id = location_area.id;
