# SQL Practice Average Aggregate Multiple Tables


---

## Exercise

In SQLFiddle, write a SQL query that uses a join to answer the following question:

What is the `name` of the fling effect (found in the table `item_fling_effect`) which has the smallest average `cost` of all the items that possess it?

Submit the name as your answer.
