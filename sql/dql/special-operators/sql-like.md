# LIKE


---

## Content

Using this table[1], let's take a look at how `LIKE` works.

The `LIKE` statement accepts a pattern string, where wildcard characters are used to denote an acceptable pattern[2].

- `%` is a **wildcard**. This means it counts for a string of any characters of any length, including nothing.
- `_` represents only one character.

Therefore, `%le` denotes any string that ends in `'le'`. `_le` denotes any string with only one character before `'le'`. 

They can be chained together into complex patterns like `___taco%` which denotes any string containing the substring `'taco'` at its 4th position, and with any number of characters after.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon
WHERE name LIKE '%le';
```

The result of this statement is the two rows of the Pok√©mon whose names end in `'le'`: Squirtle and Wartortle.

| name      | total | hp | attack | defense |
| --------- | ----- | -- | ------ | ------- |
| Squirtle  | 314   | 44 | 48     | 65      |
| Wartortle | 405   | 59 | 63     | 80      |

## Practice

Select all the columns from the `pokemon` table, keeping only the rows where the name ends with the string `'saur'`.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM pokemon
??? ??? ??? ???;
```

- WHERE
- name
- LIKE
- '%saur'
- NAME IS
- AND
- 'saur'
- 'saur%'

## Revision

Write a query that will retrieve all the Toy Story movies from the database, using the `LIKE` keyword.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE name ??? 'Toy Story???';
```

???

- LIKE
- %
- _

## Quiz

### Do you know how to match a pattern in SQL?


Consider the `location` table from our pokemon database:

| id  | region_id | name          |
| --- | --------- | ------------- |
| 1   | 4         | canalave-city |
| 2   | 1         | eterna-city   |
| 3   | 3         | pastoria-city |
| ... | ...       | ...           |

Choose the query that will get all the location records based in regions 1, 2. Also, include only locations that end in 'city':

 ???

- SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name LIKE '%city';
- SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name='%city';
- SELECT * FROM location WHERE BETWEEN 1 AND 2 AND name='%city';
- SELECT * FROM location WHERE region_id < 3 AND name LIKE '_city';
