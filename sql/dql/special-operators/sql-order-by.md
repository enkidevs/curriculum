# Order By clause


---

## Content

The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL helps you sort the data returned by your queries.

Let's look at the following `employees` table:

| id | first_name | last_name | email                                                     |
| -- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Karlene    | Pantone   | [kpantone0@topsy.com](mailto:kpantone0@topsy.com)         |
| 2  | Donnamarie | Beeho     | [dbeeho1@state.tx.us](mailto:dbeeho1@state.tx.us)         |
| 3  | Tony       | Isworth   | [tisworth2@bloglovin.com](mailto:tisworth2@bloglovin.com) |
| 4  | Esta       | Warrier   | [ewarrier3@berkeley.edu](mailto:ewarrier3@berkeley.edu)   |
| 5  | Immanuel   | Kippen    | [ikippen4@biglobe.ne.jp](mailto:ikippen4@biglobe.ne.jp)   |
| 6  | Regina     | Pantone   | [regone@stratos.org](mailto:regone@stratos.org)           |

Let's say we want to sort our results alphabetically by their `last_name`. You'd use the following syntax: 

```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name;
```

*Resulting set:*

| last_name | first_name |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Beeho     | Donnamarie |
| Isworth   | Tony       |
| Kippen    | Immanuel   |
| Pantone   | Karlene    |
| Pantone   | Regina     |
| Warrier   | Esta       |

The sorting behavior of `ORDER BY` can be explicitly changed by placing the `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) keywords after the column name: `ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC`.

> Note that the ascending order is set by default. If we want to display the result in descending order we need to put `DESC` after specifying the columns.

## Practice

The `students` table contains data about each student at an international school. Two of the columns in the table are represented by:

- `name`, for the student's name
- `language_id` to reflect the native language

Select both columns from the table and sort your resulting set in descending order by the `name` column:

```sql
SELECT name, ???
FROM students
??? name ???;
```

- language_id
- ORDER BY
- DESC
- AVG
- GROUP BY
- nature_name
- DESCENDING
- SORT BY

## Revision

Complete the following code such that the resulting set will contain the `name` and `region_id` columns, sorted by the `region_id` in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT name, region_id
FROM location
??? ???;
```

- ORDER BY
- region_id
- name
- SORT BY
- ASC
- DESC

## Quiz

### Can you order a table with SQL?


Consider the `experience` table from our `pokemon` database:

| id  | level | experience | growth_rate_id |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1   | 1     | 0          | 1              |
| 2   | 2     | 10         | 1              |
| 3   | 3     | 33         | 1              |
| 4   | 4     | 80         | 1              |
| ... | ...   | ...        | ...            |

This table shows how much experience you need to gain in order to get to level 100 based on different growth rates. Choose the query that will get all records that have level 100 and orders them descending on the amount of experience needed:

 ???

- SELECT * FROM experience WHERE level=100 ORDER BY experience DESC;
- SELECT * FROM experience WHERE level=100 ORDER BY growth_rate_id DESC;
- SELECT * FROM experience WHERE level=100 DESC ORDER BY experience;
- SELECT * FROM experience WHERE level=100 ORDER DESC BY experience;
