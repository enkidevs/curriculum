# SELECTing Columns

---
## Content

Queries in SQL are usually written to return only the columns you need. 

Here's the `pokemon` table again:

| id | name      | type_1 | type_2 | hp | attack |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|----|--------|
| 1  | Bulbasaur | Grass  | Poison | 45 | 49     |
| 2  | Ivysaur   | Grass  | Poison | 60 | 62     |
| 3  | Venusaur  | Grass  | Poison | 80 | 82     |

To see *some* of the columns in a table, use a comma-separated list of the columns you need, after `SELECT`:

```sql
SELECT 
  name, 
  hp, 
  attack
FROM 
  pokemon;
```

The query above gives the `name`, `hp` and `attack` information for all of the *rows* in the `pokemon` table. It results in:

| name      | hp | attack |
|-----------|----|--------|
| Bulbasaur | 45 | 49     |
| Ivysaur   | 60 | 62     |
| Venusaur  | 80 | 82     |

> ðŸ’¡ Running a query gives a *copy* of your original table that contains only the requested columns. This resulting table is often called the *result set*. 

The *result set* isn't stored permanently in the database, and it doesn't change any tables in the database.

If you want to try this query yourself, check the *Learn More* section for the playground link.

> Returning all data from a table is often useful to inspect new databases. But it's sometimes a bad idea to use the `SELECT *` syntax for *real production data* (which is often a lot of data). A couple reasons:
- **Unnecessary costs!** Some databases charge money per retrieved data (e.g. Google's BigQuery)
- When working with multiple tables it's possible to return two columns of the same name from two different tables (**often leading to crashes!**).

## Practice

Which of the following queries returns only the `id` and `name` columns from the `move_names` table?

???

* `SELECT id, name FROM move_names`
* `SELECT *, id, name FROM move_names`
* `SELECT ONLY id, name FROM move_names`
* `SELECT id, SELECT name, FROM move_names`
* `SELECT id AND name FROM move_names`

## Revision

Which of the following is a reason you might not want to use `SELECT *`?

???

* It might end up being expensive
* It will definitely crash your DB
* It's not practically useful in any way
