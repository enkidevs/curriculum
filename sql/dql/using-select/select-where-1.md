# WHERE (1)

---
## Content

Aside from columns, you might also want to restrict the number of records (rows) returned. 

Introducing: the `WHERE` keyword! Here it is in action:
```sql
SELECT column_1, column_2,... 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

When added to a SQL `SELECT` statement, `WHERE` allows us to select rows in a table based on conditions you set. 

The conditional statement that follows `WHERE` is evaluated for each row. If it's evaluated as true, the row will be included in the query result.

## Practice
