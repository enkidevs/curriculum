# Database server types

---
## Content

There are a number of RDBMS servers available, developed by different companies or open-source foundations. All of these databases can be interfaced with through SQL, though there are slight variations between them.

*Postgres* is a powerful free and open-source RDBMS developed and maintained by developers around the world. It doesn't require licensing fees to use, so its market share has grown considerably recently. It works well for both small and large applications.

*MySQL* is one of the world's most popular open source databases. It was acquired by Sun Microsystems, and they now require a license fee to use it. It's the **M** in the LAMP[1] web development stack. It works well for both small and large applications.

*MS Access* is an entry level database management software developed by Microsoft. It's a powerful database for small-scale projects. It uses the Jet database engine to deploy a graphical user interface.

*MS SQL Server* is a RDBMS server developed by Microsoft. It's suitable for many different workloads, from small hobby projects to huge production applications. It's not open-source, and licensing fees are required to deploy it to production. There are a large suite of powerful tools for managing MS SQL Server developed by Microsoft, and a large community that uses them.

*Oracle* is a multi-user database developed by Oracle. It's most suitable for large databases, and it's the backbone of many enterprise applications. It's not open-source, and licensing fees are required to deploy it to production.

It's important you know which server you are using, as commands can differ slightly between them. For the most part of this topic you will learn about the ANSI Standard SQL[2], with special insights dedicated to the most popular SQL implementations

## Footnotes

[1:LAMP]
Short for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, an open-source Web development platform, also called a Web stack, that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the Web server, MySQL as the RDBMS and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language.

[2:ANSI]
Throughout the years, SQL has evolved, and many versions and languages began to emerge. To unify SQL for best practices, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created specific standards for database query languages.
