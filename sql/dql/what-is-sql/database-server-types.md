## Content

There are a number of RDBMS servers available, each with different strengths:

*MySQL* is one of the world's most popular open source databases. It is most commonly used as a database for web applications. It's the **M** in the LAMP[1] web development stack. MySQL supports many different operating systems, such as: Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Some MySQL features:
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- transactions
- referential integrity
- unicode
- multi-version concurrency
- fine-grained locking

*MS Access* it's an entry level database management software. It's a powerful database for small-scale projects. MS Access is the first choice of software developers to develop application software. It uses the Jet database engine to deploy a graphical user interface.

Some MS Access features:
- option of importing and exporting the data to many formats including Excel, Outlook, ASCII
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- transactions
- referential integrity
- unicode
- multi-version concurrency
- fine-grained locking

*MS SQL Server* is a RDBMS server developed by Microsoft to store and retrieve data as requested by the user. It's suitable for different workloads and it uses primary query languages such as: T-SQL and ANSI SQL.

Some MS SQL Server features:
- database mirroring
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- transactions
- referential integrity
- unicode
- multi-version concurrency
- fine-grained locking
- a large community of professional users

*Oracle* is a multi-user database. It aims to manage big data collections among multiple clients requesting and sending data.  It is an excellent database server choice for client-server computing. It supports all major operating systems for both clients and servers.

Some Oracle features:
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- transactions
- referential integrity
- unicode
- multi-version concurrency
- fine-grained locking

It is important you understand which server you use, as commands can differ slightly between them.
