# How to use SQL?


---

## Content

OK, now you know what SQL is, and why you need it. So how do we get started?

In terms of setup, there isn't a universal program or app that you install. Different databases have different connection methods.

As you make progress, some of the Learn More links will show you how to connect to the different databases.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has adopted SQL as a standard since 1986. 

This means that any code written in ANSI should work with any flavor. So for the rest of this course, we'll teach you the ANSI Standard SQL.
