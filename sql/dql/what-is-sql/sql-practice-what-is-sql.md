# SQL Practice What is SQL

---
## Exercise

Within the SQLFiddle, click *Run SQL* on the right-hand side and observe the output.

Now, alter the query to *return one `email` address instead of returning one `name`*.

Once you've done that, click *Run SQL* again. Clicking *link* in the green bar below the output will update the URL in your browser. Submit this new URL with your answer.

In the answer field, *enter the email address that was returned*.
