# What is a database server?


---

## Content

The term **database server** can mean two different things. It might refer to a computer program (*software*) that allows clients to perform actions such as populating and querying databases. It can also refer to the physical *hardware* where data is stored.

In the *hardware* sense, a database server is a machine dedicated to performing database storage and retrieval.

For small applications, the application and its database will usually be hosted on the same computer, meaning they won't need to communicate over a network.

In applications with high volumes of data transactions, the database will typically be stored on a server or *cluster* of servers that is separate from the application host.

When referring to the *software*, a database server is the program that receives and interprets requests. These requests might include creating and populating collections of data, retrieving stored data according to certain specifications, and performing transformations on stored data.
