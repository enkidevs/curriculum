# What is an RDBMS?

---
## Content

In order to learn **SQL** we must understand what a **RDBMS** is. **RDBMS** stands for *Relational Database Management System*, a *Database Management System* that allows the user to create, update and delete the *Relational Database*.

*Relational Database* stores data in a form of well-defined tables from which we can request this data in various ways without changing the internal database organisation.

To clear things out let's take a look at a few most widely spread software implementations of such RDBMS's:
 - Oracle Database (by Oracle Corp.)
 - MySQL (by Oracle Corp.)
 - Microsoft SQL Server (by Microsoft)
 - PostgreSQL (by PostgreSQL G.D.G)

All of the above solutions are written in *C, C++ and assembly languages*. In short, a **RDBMS** is a program that sits on the server and stores data (in a very efficient way) on a hard drive in some logical order.

Then the user operates on these RDBMS's with *Query Languages*. The one most common and widely used *Query Language* is **SQL**.
