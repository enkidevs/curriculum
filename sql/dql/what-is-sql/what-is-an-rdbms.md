# What is an RDBMS?

---
## Content

*RDBMS* stands for _Relational Database Management System_, a _Database Management System_ that allows the user to create, update and delete the _Relational Database_.

_Relational Databases_ store data in _tables_, which are similar to a spreadsheet in that they've got rows and columns.

Using these tables we can query data, and store it such that others can query it. The language we use to _define_ tables is commonly referred to as SQL, but its real name is *DDL*, or _Data Definition Language_.

Here's an example of how we might define a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(500)
);
```

This lives in the *Database Server*.

Then we could query it like so:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

We query from the *Database Client*.

## Practice

How do you think we could create a table called `products`?

```sql
??? (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(500),
  cost FLOAT
);
```

* `CREATE TABLE products`
* `MAKE TABLE products`
* `rdbms.createTable('products')`
* `sql.create.table('products')`

## Revision

How do you think we could create a table called `coupons`?

```sql
??? (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(500),
  cost FLOAT
);
```

* `CREATE TABLE coupons`
* `MAKE TABLE coupons`
* `rdbms.createTable('coupons')`
* `sql.create.table('coupons')`
