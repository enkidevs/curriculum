# What is SQL?


---

## Content

*SQL* is a *Query Language*. This means it is a programming language that allows us to ask for data from a database.

*SQL* stands for *Structured Query Language* and was developed in the 1970s. Many databases use it today.

Here's an example of an SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## Practice

Have you ever used SQL before? Even if you haven't, it's meant to be readable by a human.

See if you can get all the information from a table called `items`:

???

* `SELECT * FROM items;`
* `GO GET ALL ITEMS`
* `SELECT EVERYTHING FROM items`
* `SELECT * from users`

## Revision

???

* `SELECT * FROM products;`
* `GO GET ALL PRODUCTS`
* `SELECT EVERYTHING FROM products`
* `SELECT * FROM items`
