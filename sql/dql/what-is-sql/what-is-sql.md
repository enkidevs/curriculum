# What is SQL?

## Content

*SQL* is a *Query Language*. This means it is a programming language that allows us to ask for data from a database.

*SQL* stands for *Structured Query Language* and was developed in the 1970s. Many databases use it today.

Here's an example of an SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

* `SELECT * FROM items;`
* `GO GET ALL ITEMS`
* `SELECT EVERYTHING FROM items`
* `SELECT * from users`
