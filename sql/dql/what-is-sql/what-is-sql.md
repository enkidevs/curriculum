## Content

A *Query Language*Â  is a programming language that provides enough functionality in order to operate on a database. We can think of a *Query Language* as a user interface language with particular syntax which acts as a intermediate layer between the user/database administrator and an **RDBMS** (*Relational Database Management System*).

The original and the most common query language is **SQL**. **SQL** stands for *Structured Query Language* and was developed in the 1970s. As a user, we do not need to go into detail of how **RDBMS's** work but concentrate on our part of using a relational database. This is why this course will describe **SQL** in all its details.
