# What is SQL?


---

## Content

**SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**. 

It's a query language[1] - a type of language that lets you interact[2] with a database. 

You use *queries* to do so. Here's an example: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

The query above returns all the rows and columns from the `users` table.

Next let's go over why SQL is such an important skill to learn!

## Footnotes

[1:Query Language]
Many people also call SQL a programming language.

However, SQL can only interact with a database and doesn't have the capability and many of the features needed to develop software, which is associated with programming languages.

[2:Database interactions]
Aside from getting data from it, interacting with a database can include other manipulations like:

- inserting data, 
- updating data, and 
- creating tables.
