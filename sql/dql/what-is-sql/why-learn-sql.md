# Why Learn SQL?


---

## Content

Many argue that SQL is the most useful technical skill to learn in general. Here's why:

1. It's **valuable across many roles**

Whether you're a coder, or in product, analysis, marketing, operations, QA or even sales - SQL will make your life easier.

2. You'll seem like **a superhero**

You'll be more self-sufficient with data. Others will come to you for advice. It adds a lot to your resume.

3. It's **not going anywhere**

It's been around for over 40 years. And yet it's the structure for the top 4 databases, and the 3rd most popular programming language in general.
