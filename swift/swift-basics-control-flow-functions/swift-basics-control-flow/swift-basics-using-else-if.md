# Else If

---
## Content

The `else-if` statement extends your decision-making by allowing you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

It gives your program even more flexibility to handle specific scenarios beyond just one ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù outcome.

```swift
if temperature > 30 {
    print("It's a hot day!")
} else if temperature > 20 {
    print("It's a warm day.")
} else if temperature > 10 {
    print("It's a cool day.")
} else {
    print("It's cold outside!")
}
```

Only one block will execute, even if multiple conditions are true‚Äîthe first true condition wins (going top-down)

## Practice

Complete the code below:

```swift
if gameHealth > 90 {
    print("We're good üöÄ")
} ??? gameHealth > 50 {
    print("A bit shaken up ü§ï")
} else {
    print("Be careful! ‚ö†Ô∏è")
}
```

- else
- if not
- otherwise

## Revision

What happens if multiple conditions in an if-else-if ladder are true?

???

- All true conditions will happen
- The first true condition will happen
- None of the conditions will happen
