# Using Else

---
## Content

Adding `else` provides an alternative action if the `if` condition is false.

```swift
if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
} else {
    print("It's a bit chilly.")
}
```

Now, the program has a backup plan if the first condition isn't met.


---
## Practice

If an `if` statement handles the case when a condition is true, an ??? statement
handles it when a condition is false.

- else
- otherwise
- if not
- maybe

---
## Revision

In the code below, what will be printed?

```swift
let temperature = 20
if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
} else {
    print("It's a bit chilly.")
}
```

???

- "It's a bit chilly."
- "It's a warm day!"
