# Using If Statements

---
## Content

An if lets your program make decisions.

It checks a condition and runs code only if the condition is true.

```swift
let temperature = 30
if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
}
```

Here, the program checks if `temperature` is greater than 25. If true, it prints a message.

---
## Practice

When checking a condition, an ??? statement runs code if the condition is true.

- `if`
- `check`
- `evaluate`
- `guess`

---
## Revision

In the code below, what will be printed?

```swift
let temperature = 10
if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's a warm day!")
}
```

???

- Nothing
- "It's a warm day!"
