# What is Control Flow?

---
## Content

Control flow in Swift is like giving your program a map to follow. It decides which path to take based on certain conditions.

- **Decision Making**: React differently based on inputs.
- **Efficiency**: Run only needed code.
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing data.

Imagine planning your day: if it's sunny, you go for a walk; if it rains, you stay in. Control flow helps your program make similar decisions.

> 💡 Control Flow is a way for Swift to make decisions on which code to use, when and why.
