# Defining a Function

---
## Content

To create a function in Swift, you use the `func` keyword, followed by the function's name and a pair of parentheses.

Here's a simple function that greets the user:

```swift
func greetUser() {
    print("Hello, user!")
}
```

- **`func`**: This tells Swift you're defining a function.
- **`greetUser`**: This is the name of the function.
- **`()`**: These parentheses can hold input data, but they're empty here.
- **`{}`**: Curly braces contain the code that runs when the function is called.
