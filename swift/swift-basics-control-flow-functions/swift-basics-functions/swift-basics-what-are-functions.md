# What Are Functions?

---
## Content

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

They help you organize your code and avoid repetition.

> 💡 You've seen a function before. The `print` function is a built-in function in Swift. When you use it, you’re calling a reusable task that displays data on the screen.

Imagine you're baking cookies. Instead of measuring ingredients every time, you create a recipe and give it a name like `bakeCookies`.

Now, whenever you want cookies, you simply follow the 🍪 recipe instead of starting from scratch.

> 💡 Functions let you define a task once and then call it by name whenever you need it
