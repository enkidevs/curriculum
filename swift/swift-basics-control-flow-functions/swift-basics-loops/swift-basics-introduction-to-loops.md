# Introduction to Loops

---
## Content

Loops let you run the same code multiple times, making repetitive tasks a breeze.

Why Use Loops?

- **Efficiency**: Run tasks that need to be repeated.
- **Simplicity**: Reduce the amount of code you write.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adapt to changing data or conditions.

Imagine a website wanting to send 1,000 emails to its users.

Instead of writing code for each of the 1,000 tasks, you put one task in a loop that runs 1,000 times.
