# Using For Loops

---
## Content

A **`for` loop** repeats a block of code a set number of times.

It’s perfect for tasks you need to repeat a specific number of times, like sending 1,000 emails.

  ```swift
for i in 1...1000 {
  print("Sending email \(i)")
}
  ```

This loop runs exactly 1,000 times, printing the message with the loop number each time:

```
Sending email 1
Sending email 2
Sending email 3
```

> 💡 `for` loops are ideal for tasks when you know exactly how many steps there are, so you repeat the action a set number of times.

## Practice

Finish the code to print the loop number 3 times.

```swift
??? i in ???...??? {
    print("Loop number \(i)")
}
```
