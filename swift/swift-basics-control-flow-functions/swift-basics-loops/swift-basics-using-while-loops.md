# Using While Loops

---
## Content

A while loop keeps running as long as a condition is true.

Itâ€™s perfect for tasks where you donâ€™t know in advance how many times the loop will run but have a clear condition to monitor.

```swift
var downloading = true
while downloading {
    print("Downloading file...")

    // ... some code to download the file goes here

    // stop the loop when download is finished
    downloading = false
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ `while` loops are ideal for situations where the number of steps isnâ€™t fixed, but the task depends on a condition.

---
## Practice

A `while` loop repeats code until the condition is false.

???

- true
- false

## Revision
