# Real-World Nested Loops

---
## Content

Here's how you might build a seating chart for a theater:

```swift
let rows = 3
let columns = 4
for row in 1...rows {
    for column in 1...columns {
        print("Seat: Row \(row), Column \(column)")
    }
}
```

This will print a seat number for each position in the theater:

```
Row 1, Column 1
Row 1, Column 2
---

Row 2, Column 1, Row 2, Column 2, ...

````

## Practice

How many times will the inner loop run if there are 3 rows and 4 columns?

```swift
for row in 1...rows {
    for column in 1...columns {
        print("Seat: Row \(row), Column \(column)")
    }
}
````

Imagine you’re building a social media app, and you want to display a post’s
comments along with their replies.

A ??? for loop is perfect for iterating through each comment and its associated
replies.

- nested
- single
