# Switch Statement Syntax

---
## Content

A switch statement evaluates a value and matches it against several possible cases.

Here's how you can write one:

```swift
switch fruit {
case "apple":
    print("You have an apple.")
case "banana":
    print("You have a banana.")
default:
    print("Unknown fruit.")
}
```

Here, the program checks the value of `fruit` and prints a message based on the match. There's also a default message in case of an unknown fruit.

Let's dive in.

## Practice

Finish the code:

```swift
??? fruit {
  ??? "apple":
    print("You have an apple.")
  ???:
    print("Unknown fruit.")
}
```

- switch

- default
