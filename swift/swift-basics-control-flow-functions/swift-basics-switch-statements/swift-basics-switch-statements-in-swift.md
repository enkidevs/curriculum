# Switch Statements in Swift

---
## Content

Switch statements allow you to handle multiple conditions with ease.

They're most suitable when dealing with many possible outcomes where many if-else-if steps would get cluttered.

Imagine you're sorting fruits: if it's an apple, put it in the apple basket; if it's a banana, put it in the banana basket. Switch statements help your program make similar decisions.

## Practice

Switch statements are like a more powerful version of ??? statements.

- if
- for
- while
