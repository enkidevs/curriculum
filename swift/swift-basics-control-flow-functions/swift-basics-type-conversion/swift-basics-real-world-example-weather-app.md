# Real-World Example: Weather App

---
## Content

In a weather app, you might have:

- A `Double` for the temperature.
- A `String` to display the temperature in a sentence.

Convert the `Double` to a `String` to show it in a user-friendly way:

```swift
let temperature = 72.5
let temperatureMessage = "Today's temperature is " + String(temperature) + " degrees."
```

---
## Practice

Convert the `Double` 98.6 to a string in a sentence.

```swift
let bodyTemp = 98.6
let message = "Your body temperature is " + ??? + " degrees."
```

- String(bodyTemp)
- bodyTemp
- Int(bodyTemp)
