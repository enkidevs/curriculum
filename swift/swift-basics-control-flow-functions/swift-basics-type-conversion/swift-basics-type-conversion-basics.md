# Type Conversion

---
## Content

Type conversion is changing a value from one data type to another to ensure your code works smoothly.

Imagine a fitness app that sums calories burned each minute (a Double) but displays the total calories as a whole number (Int) to truncate them down for readability.

To convert one type into another, use it like a function, by adding the value you're converting in the parenthesis after the type name.

```swift
let caloriesBurned: Double = 463.37
let caloriesBurnedTruncated = Int(caloriesBurned) // 463
```
