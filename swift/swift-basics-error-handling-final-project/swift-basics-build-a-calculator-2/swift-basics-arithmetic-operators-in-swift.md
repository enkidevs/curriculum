# Arithmetic Operators in Swift

---
## Content

In Swift, arithmetic operators are like the basic tools in a toolbox. They help you perform calculations with numbers.

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers together.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another.

For example, `3 + 2` results in `5`. Swift ensures safety by preventing value overflow, meaning numbers won't exceed their limits unexpectedly.
