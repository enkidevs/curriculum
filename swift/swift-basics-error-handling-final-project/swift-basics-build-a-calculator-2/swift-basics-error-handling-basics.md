# Error Handling Basics

---
## Content

Error handling in Swift is like having a safety net. It ensures your app doesn't crash when something goes wrong.

- Use `if` statements to check for errors, like division by zero.
- Provide clear messages to guide the user.

```swift
if secondNumber != 0 {
    print("Result: \(firstNumber / secondNumber)")
} else {
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
}
```
