# Handling User Input

---
## Content

Capturing user input in Swift is like having a conversation with your app. You ask for information, and the user responds.

- Use `readLine()` to get input from the user.
- Convert the input to a number using `Double()`.
- Use optional binding to safely handle the input.

```swift
print("Enter a number:")
if let input = readLine(), let number = Double(input) {
    print("You entered: \(number)")
} else {
    print("Invalid input.")
}
```
