# Switch Statement for Operations

---
## Content

A `switch` statement in Swift is like a decision-making tree. It helps you choose what action to take based on different conditions.

- Use `switch` to handle different operations.
- Match user input with cases like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Provide a default case for unexpected inputs.

```swift
switch operation {
case "+":
    print("Addition")
case "-":
    print("Subtraction")
case "*":
    print("Multiplication")
case "/":
    print("Division")
default:
    print("Invalid operation")
}
```
