# Types of Errors

## Content

There are three main types of errors:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in the code's structure, like missing brackets.
2. **Runtime Errors**: Happen when the program is running, like dividing by zero.
3. **Logical Errors**: The code runs but gives wrong results, like using the wrong math operator.

> ðŸ’¡ Each error type requires different strategies to fix.
