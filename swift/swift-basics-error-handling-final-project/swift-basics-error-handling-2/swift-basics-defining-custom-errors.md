# Defining Custom Errors

---
## Content

In Swift, you can create your own errors by defining an `enum` that conforms to the `Error` protocol. This allows you to specify different error cases for your app.

Here's an example:

```swift
enum FileError: Error {
    case fileNotFound
    case unreadable
    case encodingFailed
}
```

This `enum` defines three possible errors related to file handling.

> ðŸ’¡ Think of custom errors as labels you create to describe specific problems in your app.
