# Throwing Errors in Functions

---
## Content

In Swift, functions that might encounter problems are marked with `throws`. This indicates that the function can throw an error during execution.

Here's how you define a throwing function:

```swift
func readFile(at path: String) throws -> String {
    // Code that might throw an error
}
```

When calling this function, you must use `try` to handle potential errors.

> ðŸ’¡ Marking a function with `throws` is like putting a warning sign that it might encounter issues.
