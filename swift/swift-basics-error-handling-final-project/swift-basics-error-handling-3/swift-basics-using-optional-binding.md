# Using Optional Binding

---
## Content

**Optional binding** is a way to check if an optional contains a value and use it if it does.

Think of it like checking if a light switch is on before entering a room. If it's on, you proceed; if not, you handle it differently.

Here's how you use optional binding:

```swift
if let actualGift = gift {
    print("Received: \(actualGift)")
} else {
    print("No gift available")
}
```

This code checks if `gift` has a value and uses it if available.
