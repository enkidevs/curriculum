# What are Optionals?

---
## Content

In Swift, **optionals** are like a box that might contain a value or might be empty. They help you handle situations where a value could be missing.

Think of it like a gift box. Sometimes there's a gift inside, and sometimes it's empty. Optionals let you safely check if there's something inside before using it.

Here's how you declare an optional:

```swift
var gift: String?
```

The `?` indicates that `gift` might contain a `String` or it might be `nil` (empty).
