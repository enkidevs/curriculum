# Handling Runtime Errors

---
## Content

Functions that can throw errors are marked with `throws`. This indicates that the function might encounter a problem.

Here's how you define a throwing function:

```swift
func someFunctionThatThrows() throws {
    // Code that might throw an error
}
```

When you call this function, you use `try` to handle potential errors.

> 💡 Marking a function with `throws` is like putting a warning sign that it might encounter issues.
