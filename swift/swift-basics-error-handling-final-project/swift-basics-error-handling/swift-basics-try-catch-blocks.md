# Try-Catch Blocks

---
## Content

In Swift, you use `do`, `try`, and `catch` to handle errors. This structure lets you attempt an operation and catch any errors that occur.

Here's a basic example:

```swift
do {
    try someFunctionThatThrows()
} catch {
    print("An error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

This code tries to run `someFunctionThatThrows()`. If an error occurs, it catches the error and prints a message.

> ðŸ’¡ Think of `try` as attempting a task, and `catch` as catching any problems that arise.
