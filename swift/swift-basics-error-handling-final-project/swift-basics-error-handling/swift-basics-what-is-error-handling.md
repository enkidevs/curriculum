# What is Error Handling?

---
## Content

Error handling in Swift is like having a safety net for your code. It helps you manage unexpected situations and keep your app running smoothly.

Imagine you're driving a car. You have seatbelts and airbags to protect you in case of an accident. Error handling in programming is similar—it's a way to protect your app from crashing when things go wrong.
