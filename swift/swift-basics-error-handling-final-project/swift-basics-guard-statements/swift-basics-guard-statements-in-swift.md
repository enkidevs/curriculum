# Guard Statements in Swift

---
## Content

ðŸš€ **Guard statements** in Swift are like checkpoints in your code. They ensure certain conditions are met before proceeding, helping you handle errors and keep your program running smoothly.

Imagine you're checking into a hotel. The receptionist verifies your reservation before giving you a room key. A guard statement works similarlyâ€”it checks conditions and only lets the code continue if everything is in order.
