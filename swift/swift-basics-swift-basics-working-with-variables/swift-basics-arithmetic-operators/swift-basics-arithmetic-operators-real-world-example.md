# Real-World Example

---
## Content

Imagine youâ€™re building a food delivery app where users can split the total bill
among friends.

This example uses the division operator (/) to calculate how much each person
needs to pay:

```swift
let totalBill = 87.50 // Total bill amount
let numberOfFriends = 4.0
let amountPerPerson = totalBill / numberOfFriends // 21.875
```
