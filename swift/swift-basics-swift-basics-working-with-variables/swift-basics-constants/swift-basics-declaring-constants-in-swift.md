# Declaring Constants

---
## Content

In Swift, you declare a constant using the `let` keyword.

```swift
let maximumLoginAttempts = 3
```

- **`let`**: This tells Swift you're creating a constant.
- **`maximumLoginAttempts`**: This is the name of your constant.
- **`3`**: This is the value stored in the constant.

> ðŸ’¡ Once you set a constant, you cannot change its value.

## Practice

How do you declare a constant in Swift?

```swift

```

- let
- var
- const

---
## Revision

What does the following code do?

```swift
let maxAttempts = 5
```

It creates a ??? named maxAttempts with the value 5.

- constant
- variable
- maximum
