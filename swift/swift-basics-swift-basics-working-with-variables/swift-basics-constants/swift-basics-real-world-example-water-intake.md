# Real-World Example

---
## Content

Imagine an app that tracks your water intake. Use a variable for the amount of water you drink each day:

```swift
var dailyWaterIntake = 0
```

As you drink more, update the variable:

```swift
dailyWaterIntake = 2
```

For a constant, use the recommended daily intake:

```swift
let recommendedIntake = 8
```

> ðŸ’¬ Your turn! Can you think of one real world example for a variable and another for a constant? Share your thoughts in the comments.
