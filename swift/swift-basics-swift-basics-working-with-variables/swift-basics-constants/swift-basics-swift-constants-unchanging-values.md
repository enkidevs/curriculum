# Why Use Constants?

---
## Content

Constants are help you with code:

- Prevent accidental changes to important values
- Make it obvious which values should not change
- Ensure important values remain fixed forever

If you try to change a constant, Swift will give you an error:

```swift
let pi = 3.14159 // Declared as a constant

// Later in the code:
pi = 3.14 // Error! Cannot assign to a constant.
```
