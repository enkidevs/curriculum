# Variables vs. Constants

---
## Content

Variables in Swift are like flexible containers that can hold data and be updated whenever needed.

> ðŸ’¡ Use variables to store data that might change, like a userâ€™s score in a game or the current temperature.

In contrast, constants are like locked boxesâ€”once you set their value, it cannot be changed.

> ðŸ’¡ Use constants to store data that should stay the same, like the number of days in a week or the value of pi.
