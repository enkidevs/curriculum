# Implicit vs. Explicit Types

---
## Content

If you donâ€™t specify a type for a variable or constant, Swift will automatically determine the type for you.

The fancy name for this process is **type inference**.

> ðŸ’¡ A variable without a written type has an **implicit** type.

 ```swift
  let implicitInteger = 70 // Swift knows it's an Int
//                   ^ no type here
  ```

On the other hand, you can specify the type yourself to make it crystal clear:

> ðŸ’¡ A variable with a written type has an **explicit** type.

  ```swift
  let explicitDouble: Double = 70 // Ensures it's a Double
  ```

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use explicit types when you want to clarify the kind of data youâ€™re working with, especially when it might not be obvious or when precision is important.

## Practice

What kind of type do these variables have?

```swift
let numberOfPages = 300 // ???
let firstName: String = "Enki" // ???
```

- implicit type
- explicit type

## Revision

```swift
let implicitValue = 42
```

???

- Int
- Double
- String
