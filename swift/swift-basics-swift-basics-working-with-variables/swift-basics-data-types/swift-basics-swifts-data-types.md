# Swift's Data Types

---
## Content

If a variable is a labeled box where you can store things, a data type is the size and shape of the box.

> 💡 Just like you wouldn’t use the same box for storing shoes and a TV, Swift uses specific data types for storing different kinds of values, like numbers or text.

Swift uses data types to ensure the “box” is the perfect size for what you’re storing.

> 💡 Storing shoes in a TV-sized box would be wasting a lot of space.

You add a type after the box name, like this:

```swift
let box: Type = value
//         ^^^^^
```

Let's see some examples.
