# Type Safety in Swift

---
## Content

Swift is a **type-safe** language, meaning it ensures variables are used with the correct data types, like a bouncer checking IDs at a club.

- **Prevents Mistakes**: Stops you from mixing types.
- **Early Error Detection**: Catches errors right away.

  ```swift
  var name = "Alice"
  // name = 42 // Error: Can't assign an Int to a String
  ```

> ðŸ’¡ Type safety leads to more reliable and bug-free code as variables their intended kind of data forever.
