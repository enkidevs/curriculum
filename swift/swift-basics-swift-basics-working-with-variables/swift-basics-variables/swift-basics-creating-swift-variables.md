# Creating Variables

---
## Content

In Swift, you create a variable using the `var` keyword.

> ðŸ’¡ A word like `var` means something in Swift so it's called a *keyword* while a word like `Enki` doesn't and is not a keyword.

Here's how you can create a variable to store your favorite color:

```swift
var favoriteColor = "blue"
```

- **`var`**: This tells Swift you're creating a variable.
- **`favoriteColor`**: This is the name of your variable.
- **`"blue"`**: This is the value stored in the variable.

> ðŸ’¡ Creating a variable is usually called *declaring a variable*.
