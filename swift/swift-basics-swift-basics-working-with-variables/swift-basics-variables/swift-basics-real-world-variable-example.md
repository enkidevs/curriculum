# Real-World Example

---
## Content

Think of a simple app that tracks your daily steps.

You could use a variable to store the number of steps you take each day:

```swift
var dailySteps = 0
```

As you walk, you update `dailySteps` to reflect your progress:

```swift
dailySteps = 1000
// and so on...
```

## Practice

Finish the code to update the likes counter on your Instagram post.

```swift
var likes = 3
likes ???
```

- = 5
- < 5
- update 5

---
## Revision

If you walk 2000 steps, how would you update `dailySteps`?

```swift
var dailySteps = 1000
dailySteps ???
```

- = 2000
- < 2000
- is 2000
