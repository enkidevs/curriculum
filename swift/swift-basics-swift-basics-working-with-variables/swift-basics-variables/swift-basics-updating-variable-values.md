# Updating Variables

---
## Content

You can change the value of a variable anytime.

Let's say your favorite color changes to "green":

```swift
var favoriteColor = "blue"
favoriteColor = "green" // we changed it!
```

Now, `favoriteColor` holds the value "green."

> 💡 Think of the equal sign as storing a new thing (in this case `"green"`) inside a labeled box (in this case "favoriteColor").
