# Hello World

---
## Content

Let's write your first Swift program:

```swift
print("Hello, Swift!")
```

This line of code tells the computer to display 'Hello, Swift!' on the screen.

> 💡 The term *printing* is used to mean displaying text on the screen.

In Swift, `print` is a special command that takes anything in between parenthesis and shows it on the screen.

```swift
print("Hello, Swift!")
//    ^             ^
```
By the way, if you need to add explanations around your code, you can add `//` at the start of the line to create a *comment*.

> 💡 Comments are ignored by Swift and are just for humans to add notes.
