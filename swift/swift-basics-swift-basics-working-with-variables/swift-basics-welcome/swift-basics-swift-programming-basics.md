# Hello, Swift!

---
## Content

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language used mainly for building apps in Apple's ecosystem.

> ðŸ’¡ By learning Swift, you'll be on your way to building apps like Instagram or even working at Apple.

The words you use in Swift and the way you format sentences is more similar to English than many other programming languages.

For example, here's how you might show check if a value is an integer:

```swift
if value is Int {
    // do something
}
```

Notice how this code reads almost the same as the original sentence? This is what makes Swift approachable and fun to learn.

Let's get started ðŸš€
