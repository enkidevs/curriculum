# Swift's Simple Syntax

---
## Content

Let's see another example of how Swift sounds close to English.

For example, here's how you might check if a number is greater than another:

```swift
if myAge >= legalAge {
    print("You can have a beer!")
}
```

Similarly to how English has rules for how we combine words to form sentences, Swift has rules for how we combine words to form code.

> 💡 The set of rules that define how we combine words to form code is called **syntax**.

The rules for how we can combine Swift words to make a valid Swift program are
together called:

???

- syntax
- ruleset
- rules group
- programs
