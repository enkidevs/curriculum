# Real-World Example

---
## Content

Imagine you're building a shopping list app. Use a `for-in` loop to display each item:

```swift
let shoppingList = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"]
for item in shoppingList {
    print("Don't forget to buy \(item)")
}
```

> 💡 Iteration helps you manage collections of data efficiently.

## Practice

Use a `for-in` loop to print each task:

```swift
let tasks = ["Clean", "Cook", "Shop"]
for ??? in tasks {
    print(task)
}
```

- task
- item
- color

## Revision

In the shopping list example, the loop prints a message for each ???.

- item
- fruit
- number
