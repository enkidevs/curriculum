# Using `for-in` Loops

---
## Content

🚀 A **`for-in` loop** lets you iterate over each element in an array, performing actions on each one.

```swift
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
for fruit in fruits {
    print("I love \(fruit)")
}
```

> 💡 Use `for-in` loops to simplify your code and make it more readable.

## Practice

Complete the loop to print each color:

```swift
let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
for color in ??? {
    print(color)
}
```

- colors
- fruits
- numbers
