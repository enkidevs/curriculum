# Accessing Array Elements

---
## Content

You can access elements in an array using their index, which starts at 0.

```swift
let firstFruit = favoriteFruits[0] // "Apple"
```

- **`favoriteFruits[0]`**: This retrieves the first item in the array.

> 💡 Indexing starts at 0, so the first element is at position 0.

## Practice

```swift
let secondColor = favoriteColors[???]
