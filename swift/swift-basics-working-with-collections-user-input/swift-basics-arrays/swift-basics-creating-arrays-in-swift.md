# Creating Arrays in Swift

---
## Content

In Swift, you create an array using square brackets `[]` and separate each item with a comma.

```swift
var favoriteFruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
```

- **`var`**: This tells Swift you're creating a variable.
- **`favoriteFruits`**: This is the name of your array.
- **`["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]`**: This is the list of items in your array.

> 💡 Arrays can store any type of data, like numbers or strings.
