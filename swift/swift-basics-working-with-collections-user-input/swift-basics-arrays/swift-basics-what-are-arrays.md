## Content

Arrays are like lists that hold multiple values in a specific order. They help you manage collections of data efficiently.

Imagine you have a box of chocolates. Each chocolate is a different flavor, and you want to keep track of them. An array is like a list of those chocolates, where each position in the list corresponds to a specific chocolate.
