# Invalid Input Explained

---
## Content

🚀 **Invalid Input** happens when a user provides data that your program doesn't expect or can't process. Handling these errors is crucial for creating robust and user-friendly apps.

Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you order a dish that's not on the menu. The waiter needs to handle this gracefully, perhaps by suggesting alternatives. Similarly, your app should manage unexpected input smoothly.

- **User Experience**: Prevents crashes and keeps your app running smoothly.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures your program only processes valid data.
- **Error Prevention**: Helps avoid unexpected behavior and bugs.
