# Updating Array Elements

## Content

You can change an element in an array by assigning a new value to its index.

```swift
favoriteFruits[0] = "Apricot"
```

Now, `favoriteFruits` contains `"Apricot", "Cherry", "Date"`.

> 💡 Use indexing to directly update elements in your array, keeping your data current.
