# Real-World Input Example

---
## Content

Imagine you're building a simple quiz app. Use `readLine()` to get the user's answer:

```swift
print("What is the capital of France?")
if let answer = readLine() {
    if answer.lowercased() == "paris" {
        print("Correct!")
    } else {
        print("Try again.")
    }
}
```

> 💡 This example shows how capturing user input can make your app interactive and engaging.


---
