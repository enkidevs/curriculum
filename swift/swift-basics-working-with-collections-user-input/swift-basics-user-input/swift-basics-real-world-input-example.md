# Real-World Input Example

---
## Content

Imagine you're building a simple quiz app. Use `readLine()` to get the user's answer:

```swift
print("What is the capital of France?")
if let answer = readLine() {
    if answer.lowercased() == "paris" {
        print("Correct!")
    } else {
        print("Try again.")
    }
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ This example shows how capturing user input can make your app interactive and engaging.

---
## Practice

In the quiz app example, `readLine()` is used to ??? the user's answer.

- capture
- display
- ignore

---
## Revision

The quiz app checks if the answer is ??? to determine correctness.

- "paris"
- "london"
- "rome"
