# User Input Basics

---
## Content

ðŸš€ **User Input** is how you get information from the user to use in your program. In Swift, capturing user input makes your apps interactive.

Imagine you're at a restaurant, and the waiter asks for your order. You tell them what you want, and they use that information to serve you. Capturing user input in programming is similarâ€”you're asking the user for information and using it in your app.

> ðŸ’¡ User input allows for interactivity, customization, and data collection in your apps.
