# User Input Basics

---
## Content

🚀 **User Input** is how you get information from the user to use in your program. In Swift, capturing user input makes your apps interactive.

Imagine you're at a restaurant, and the waiter asks for your order. You tell them what you want, and they use that information to serve you. Capturing user input in programming is similar—you're asking the user for information and using it in your app.

> 💡 User input allows for interactivity, customization, and data collection in your apps.
