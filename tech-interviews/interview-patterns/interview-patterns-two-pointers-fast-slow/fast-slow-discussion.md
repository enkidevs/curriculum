# Fast & Slow Pointers Discussion

Let's explore the mathematical intuition behind Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm.

Consider a linked list with a cycle:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ^         |
          |         v
          8 <- 7 <- 6
```

Key insights:
- Let's say distance from head to cycle start is 'x'
- Distance from cycle start to meeting point is 'y'
- Remaining distance of cycle is 'z'
- When they meet:
  * Slow pointer has moved: x + y
  * Fast pointer has moved: x + y + n(y + z) where n is some integer
  * Fast moves twice as fast: 2(x + y) = x + y + n(y + z)
  * This simplifies to: x = n(y + z) - y
  * Therefore, x equals the remaining distance to cycle start!

This is why moving a pointer to head after meeting and moving both at same speed works.

Common variations:
- Finding middle element (fast moves 2x)
- Finding kth from end (offset pointers by k)
- Finding cycle length (count steps after meeting)
