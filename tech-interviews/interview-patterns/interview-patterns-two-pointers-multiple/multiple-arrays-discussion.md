# Multiple Arrays Pattern Discussion

Let's explore the tradeoffs and variations in Multiple Arrays problems.

Consider merging k sorted arrays:
```python
# Approach 1: Merge two at a time
arrays = [[1,4,5], [1,3,4], [2,6]]
result = arrays[0]
for i in range(1, len(arrays)):
    result = merge_two_sorted(result, arrays[i])

# Approach 2: Use min heap
import heapq
pointers = [(arr[0], i, 0) for i, arr in enumerate(arrays) if arr]
heapq.heapify(pointers)
result = []
while pointers:
    val, arr_idx, elem_idx = heapq.heappop(pointers)
    result.append(val)
    if elem_idx + 1 < len(arrays[arr_idx]):
        next_elem = arrays[arr_idx][elem_idx + 1]
        heapq.heappush(pointers, (next_elem, arr_idx, elem_idx + 1))
```

Space-Time Tradeoffs:
1. Multiple Pointers
   - Pro: O(1) space
   - Con: More complex pointer management

2. Hash Set/Map
   - Pro: Simpler code
   - Con: O(n) space

3. Sorting First
   - Pro: Can optimize subsequent operations
   - Con: O(n log n) time overhead

Common Variations:
- K-way merge
- Multi-way partitioning
- Array rearrangement
- Interval merging
