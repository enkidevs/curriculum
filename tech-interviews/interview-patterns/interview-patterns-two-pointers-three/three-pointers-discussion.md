# Three Pointers Pattern Discussion

Let's explore the variations and optimizations of the Three Pointers pattern.

Consider this array: `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`
Finding triplets that sum to zero:
```python
# First iteration (i = 0, num = -4):
# left = 1, right = 5
# sum = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3 < 0
# Move left pointer...

# Second iteration (i = 1, num = -1):
# left = 2, right = 5
# sum = -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 âœ“
# Found triplet: [-1, -1, 2]
```

Key optimizations:
1. Early termination:
   - If first number > target, break (array is sorted)
   - If three smallest numbers > target, break
   - If three largest numbers < target, continue

2. Two-way skip:
   - Skip duplicates from both ends
   - Can combine with binary search for better performance

3. Space-time tradeoffs:
   - Hash set for seen values vs sorting
   - Trading space for duplicate handling

Common variations:
- Triplet closest to target
- Count of triplets in range
- Triangles in array
- Three-way partitioning
