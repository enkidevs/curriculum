# Two Pointers Pattern Discussion

Let's explore when and why to use the Two Pointers pattern.

Common problem types where Two Pointers excel:
- Finding pairs in sorted arrays (sum, difference)
- Removing duplicates
- Reversing arrays or strings
- Finding palindromes
- Merging sorted arrays
- Finding subarrays with specific properties

```python
# Example: Reverse string using two pointers
def reverse_string(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```

When deciding whether to use Two Pointers, ask yourself:
- Is the input sorted or can it be sorted?
- Are you searching for a pair or subarray?
- Would using two indices help avoid nested loops?
- Can the problem be solved by converging towards the middle?
