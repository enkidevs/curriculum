> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Create a function that returns the index of the given `target` value from a sorted `numbers` list. Your algorithm should use `O(log n)` runtime complexity.**

For example, if the input list is:
```python
numbers = [-5, -3, 1, 6, 8, 11]
``` 

and the target value is:
```python
target = 6
```

the function should return the index of the target value inside the input list:
```plain-text
3 
```

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Since the input list is sorted, you can use a binary search algorithm to find the target value in the list. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of `O(log n)`, which means it can find the target value in a list of `n` elements in a time that grows logarithmically with the size of the input.

In a binary search, you start by comparing the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target value is smaller than the middle element, you can discard the second half of the list, because the target value cannot be in that half (since the list is sorted). Otherwise, you can discard the first half of the list.

You then repeat this process on the remaining half of the list, until you either find the target value or determine that it does not exist in the list.
