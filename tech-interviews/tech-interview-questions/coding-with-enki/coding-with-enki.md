> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a program that generates a new string list from the given `numbers` list.**

Conditions:
  - If a number is divisible by both 2 and 4, replace it with "I'm".
  - If a number is not divisible by any number but 1 or itself (i.e. a prime number), replace it with "Enki".
  - If a number is divisible by 7, replace with "with".
  - If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace with "coding".

For instance, if the input list was:
```pytho
numbers = [17, 19, 23, 29]
```

The result would be:
```python
newList = ["Enki", "Enki", "Enki", "Enki"]
```

Since all of these numbers satisfy the second condition.
