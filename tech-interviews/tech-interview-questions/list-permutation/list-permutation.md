> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that takes in list of intengers and returns a new list for each possible permutation.**

For instance, if the input list is 
```python
ints = [4, 0, 7]
``` 
the function should return:
```python
# [4, 0, 7]
# [4, 7, 0]
# [0, 7, 4]
# [0, 4, 7]
# [7, 4, 0]
# [7, 0, 4]
```
