> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Write a function that returns the longest substring with no repeating characters from a given `string`.**

Here is an example of how the function can be used:

```python
string1 = "asgegsagefasg"
find_longest_substring(string1)

# "gef"

string2 = "abcabcbb"
find_longest_substring(string2)

# "abc"
```

[1: Hints]

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 

For example, the substrings of the string "abcde" are:

"a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "b", "bc", "bcd", "bcde", "c", "cd", "cde", "d", "de", and "e".
