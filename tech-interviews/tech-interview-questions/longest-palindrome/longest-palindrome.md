## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

The time complexity of this task is *O(N)* where *N* is the length of our `letters` string.

The Space complexity is *O(1)* as *s* is a fixed size of the alphabet.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards. I.e. **civic**, **level**, **madam**, and so on...

In an even palindrome, each letter has an equal partner on the opposite side.

In an odd palindrome, there is a single non-partnered letter in the middle of the pallindrome.

If each letter occurs X times, we know that x // 2 * 2 is the number of letters that can be partnered.
