> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Return the most frequent element from the `numbers` list. The time complexity should be better than `O(n logn)`.**

Sample program:
```python
numbers = [1, 1, 8, 6, 4, 13, 1, 7, 8, 6]
most_frequent = most_frequent_element(numbers)
print(most_frequent)  
# Should print 1
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
