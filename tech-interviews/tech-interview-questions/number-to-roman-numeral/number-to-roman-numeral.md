> üë©‚Äçüíª Your task is to: **Generate Roman numerals from a given list of numbers.**

Roman numeral symbols are:

| Roman Numeral | Integer |
|:-------------:|:-------:|
| I             | 1       |
| V             | 5       |
| X             | 10      |
| L             | 50      |
| C             | 100     |
| D             | 500     |
| M             | 1000    |

**Note: There are several rules Roman numerals follow. Take a look at this note[1].**

Sample list to use:
```python
numbers = [1, 23, 44, 59, 1111, 127, 999]
```

[1: Notes]

- When a value increases, up to 3 times, the symbol is added to itself.

If the value increases more, you subtract from the next highest numeral:

| Roman Numeral | Integer |
|:-------------:|:-------:|
| I             | 1       |
| II            | 2       |
| III           | 3       |
| IV            | 4       |
| V             | 5       |
| VI            | 6       |
| VII           | 7       |
| VIII          | 8       |
| IX            | 9       |
| X             | 10      |

- When a symbol of smaller value is after a symbol of a greater value, they are added together. If the smaller symbol is before it, they are subtracted.

| Number | Calculation | Result |
|:------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| IV     | V - I       | 4      |
| VI     | V + I       | 6      |

Symbols like V, L, D never repeat. That is beacuse VV is X, LL is C, DD is M.

From symbols V and X you can only subtract I, from symbols L, C and M, you can only subtract X.

Here's a sample of wrong vs correct way of writting numbers

| Sample |   ‚ùå  |  ‚úÖ |
|:------:|:------:|:---:|
|   41   |  XXXXI | XLI |
|   100  |   LL   |  C  |
|   59   | LVIIII | LIX |
|    7   |  IIIX  | VII |
|   111  |  CVVI  | CXI |
|   400  |  CCCC  |  CD |
