    # Welcome to the Python coding playground.
    # Implement a function that returns a new list such that the current element is the product of all elements in the given list excluding itself. The function should have a runtime complexity of O(n).

    # Sample list:
    numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]

    # Sample return:
    product_list(numbers)
    # [504, 168, 126, 84, 72]

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Implement a function that returns a new list such that the current element is the product of all elements in the `numbers` list excluding itself. The function should have a runtime complexity of `O(n)`.**

For instance, if the input list:
```python
numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6]
```

you would return:
```python
product_list(numbers)

# [72, 24, 18, 12]
```
