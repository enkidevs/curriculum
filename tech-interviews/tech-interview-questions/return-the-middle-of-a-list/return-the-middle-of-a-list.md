    # Welcome to the Python coding playground.
    # Create a function that finds and returns the middle element of a list. If the list has 2 middle elements, return the first one.

    # Sample program:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    result = find_middle(numbers)
    
    # result should be 3
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    result = find_middle(numbers)
    
    # result should be 4

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Implement a function that finds and returns the middle element of a list `numbers`. If the list has 2 middle elements, return the first one.**

Sample program:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = find_middle(numbers)

# result should be 3

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
result = find_middle(numbers)

# result should be 4
```

To solve this, try using some of the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)

Give it an honest try, and feel free to share your solution!
