    # Welcome to the Python coding playground.
    # Return true if the characters from the given letters string can be used to construct any of the word strings; otherwise return false. You can use each letter only once.

    # Sample strings to use:
    letters = 'aaabnn'
    word1 = 'banana'
    word2 = 'apple'
    word3 = 'ban'
    word4 = 'bananas'

    # Type your code here:

    print(can_construct_words(letters, word1)) 
    # True
    print(can_construct_words(letters, word2)) 
    # False
    print(can_construct_words(letters, word3)) 
    # True
    print(can_construct_words(letters, word4)) 
    # False

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Check if the characters in the `letters` string can be used to construct any of the `word` strings without repeating any letters. Return `true` if any of the `word` strings can be constructed, and `false` otherwise.**

Sample strings to use:
```python
letters = 'aaabnn'
word1 = 'banana'
word2 = 'apple'
word3 = 'ban'
word4 = 'bananas'

print(can_construct_words(letters, word1)) 
# True
print(can_construct_words(letters, word2)) 
# False
print(can_construct_words(letters, word3)) 
# True
print(can_construct_words(letters, word4)) 
# False
```
