> 👩‍💻 Your task is to: **Find which two numbers of the given `numbers` list, when summed up, equal the `target` value. Return their indices.**

Sample program:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 7, 12]
target1 = 6
target2 = 11

print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target1))  
# (1, 2)

print(find_indices_of_target_sum(numbers, target2))  
# (2, 3)
```

To solve this, try using the following concepts:
- function definition (`def x(): ...`)
- built-in methods (`len()`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`, `for x in y...`)
