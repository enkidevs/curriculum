A data structure is a way we store and organize our data. 

Think about organizing books in a room - we can keep those books on a shelf, or make a stack of them on a table or even just put them randomly anywhere in the room.

Great programs (and great interview solutions) do the same thing! They organize data to make doing important tasks more efficient.

It's crucial to become confident in fundamental data structures if you want to excel in interviews (and in your job!)
