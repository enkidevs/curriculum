# Arrays Operations

---
## Content

If you know its position, finding an element in an array is O(1).

If you don't, it's O(N) because, in the worst case, we have to look through the whole array if the element we're looking for happens to be at the end.

Adding a new element is O(N) because we have to shift other elements to make room for it.

Unless you're adding to the start or end of the array, which is O(1) because no shifting is needed.

Removing an element is also O(N) because we have to shift other elements to fill up the empty space.

The exception is removing from either edge being O(1) as no shifting is needed.

> ðŸ’¡ Be careful when altering or combining arrays in your interview solutions as that's usually O(N). If you can, alter at the start or end, which is O(1).

## Practice

What's the Big-O for finding an element in an array if you don't know its position?

???

- O(N)
- O(NÂ²)
- O(log N)
- O(1)
