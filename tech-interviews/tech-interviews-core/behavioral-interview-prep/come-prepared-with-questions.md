# Come Prepared with Questions

---
## Content

Most interviews end by offering the candidate a few minutes to ask questions.

This is a great chance to learn more about the company and see if you'd like to work there. 

Not having questions makes it seem you're not that interested in the role, or you're not too proactive in general.

Let's look at an example question for each category:

---

#### Ask about work projects

*"What is the most exciting or challenging project you've worked on here so far?"*

---

#### Ask about the role

*"What would be the most critical problem I might be solving if I joined the team?"*

---

#### Ask about the culture
  
*"What is something you wish was different about your job?"*

---

#### Ask about the org setup
  
*"How does the company decide on what to work on next?"*

---

#### Ask about team leadership or management**

*"Can you tell me about a time you resolved a conflict in the team?"*

This last one might be more suitable if the interviewer has a managerial role in the company.
