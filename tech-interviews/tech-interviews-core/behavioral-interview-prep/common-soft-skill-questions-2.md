# Bonus: Answering Common Qs 2/2

---
## Content

*Q: "Tell me about a time you failed."*

This is the perfect time to share a story about your resilience, how you learn from tough times and most importantly, how you grow from your experiences. 

Have at least one specific story to share, and be as clear as possible.


*Q: "Why are you leaving your job?"*

Answer this one positively!

Highlight why the new role is a better fit for your goals.

Avoid saying anything negative about your former employer. You don't want to come off touchy about the subject.


*Q: "How do you handle stress?"*

Everyone gets stressed - no point in hiding it.

Focus on 1-2 specific tactics for stress management, like going for a walk or meditation. 

You can also highlight an instance when stress led you to rise to the occasion.


*Q: "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"*

This is an assessment of your ambition. And whether your ambition aligns with your growth opportunity at the company.

This one's more open-ended than the others, so you can be a little creative here. Just try to relate it to your desired role.

> ðŸ’¬ We'll cover introductions and post-interview questions in more detail in upcoming workouts.
