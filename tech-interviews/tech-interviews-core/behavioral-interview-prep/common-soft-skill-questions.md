# Bonus: Answering Common Qs 1/2

---
## Content

Many software engineering candidates tend to struggle with behavioral questions that come up in the middle of technical interviews. 

Here are some common questions and tips for how to answer them:


1. *Q: "Why this company?"*

This is a standard question. But, unfortunately, answering poorly can hurt your chances of getting the job. 

Try to avoid a generic answer - you should have 2-3 unique points about the company prepared beforehand. 

Ideally, the reasons are genuinely appealing to you and they show through your body language.


2. *Q: "What are your strengths?"*

Stick to 1-2 strengths that you can relate directly to the role and company. 

Where possible, leverage storytelling - bring them to life with anecdotes!


3. *Q: "What are your weaknesses?"*

Don't try to subtly pitch a strength as a weakness. 

Go for a real weakness and address how you're working on it.
