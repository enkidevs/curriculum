## Content

Let's look at an example introduction for a hypothetical Android Developer position at JengaHub.

We've commented on why each part is good!

*"Hi, I'm Al, a recent grad from XYZ University with a degree in Computer Science."*

> ðŸ’¡ Simple, to the point background.

*"Back in school, I built an app for planning class timetables. It still gets around 10k page views each month and is used by over 200 students at my school."*

> ðŸ’¡ This is an example of an **impactful achievement** that is functional and stands out.

*"Typically, I code apps in Kotlin, but I built this one using Flutter because I wanted to learn a different modern dev tool."*

> ðŸ’¡ This highlights skills in modern Android technologies, as well as passion for learning new ones.

*"I'm interested in a role at JengaHub because I've been an avid player of your games since I was a kid and would love to have a chance to design and build them."*

> ðŸ’¡ This shows passion for the company, along with sincere interest.
