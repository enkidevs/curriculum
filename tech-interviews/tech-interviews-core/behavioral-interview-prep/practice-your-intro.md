# Practice Your Intro

---
## Content

Almost always, the first questions you'll get in a tech interview will be something like: 

*"Tell me about your journey so far. How did you get interested in coding, and why is this role a good fit for you?"*

This is a chance for you to tell your story. But since you won't have much time, you must be clear and *to the point*!

> ðŸ’¡ You want the intro to feel natural and genuine. Practice by writing it out or saying it to a friend.

The interviewer wants to know what you are doing these days, how you got here, and why you're in this career in the first place.

Think about what got you into tech and answer honestly. 

Put yourself in their shoes. **What aspects of your career so far would impress you if you heard them from someone else?**

Make sure to emphasize any skills you have that are relevant to the company - for instance, experience with their tech stack.
