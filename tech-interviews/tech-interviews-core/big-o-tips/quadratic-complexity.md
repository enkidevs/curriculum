# Recognizing Quadratic Complexity

---
## Content

Imagine that you have a list of cities and want to find all mentions of each city in a pile of magazines.

This complexity is quadratic, but it's not O(NÂ²). Instead, it's O(C * M), where C is the number of cities and M is the number of magazines.

Although sometimes you can't do better than it, quadratic performance is considered slow.

> ðŸ’¡ If a piece of code is processing one thing for every item of another thing, it most likely has quadratic complexity.

## Practice

O(NÂ²) is usually the most efficient solution for most interview problems.

## Revision

What's the complexity of this program:

For every item in list A, find all items in list B that are equal to it.

???

- O(A * B)
- O(A + B)
- O(AlogA)
- O(ABlogAB)
