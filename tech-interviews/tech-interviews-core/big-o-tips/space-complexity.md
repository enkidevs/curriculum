# Space Complexity

---
## Content

Space complexity is affected if your code creates new structures from the input data, such as copying it into another place, temporarily storing it somewhere, etc.

A real-life example would be washing the dishes. If you're putting the clean dishes somewhere else, you're using O(N) space, where N is the number of dishes.

> ðŸ’¡ If you're using extra space and the amount of used space depends on the size of the input data, you're affecting space complexity.

One of the best ways to make your interview solutions faster is to sacrifice space to store the input data in a way such that it can be retrieved more efficiently.

Imagine that somebody gives you a box of unsorted books and your goal is to make it easy to find a book by its name. A way you could make that task fast is to move and sort them onto a labelled shelf.

> ðŸ’¡ If you're not sure how to make your solution faster, trade space to gain time!

## Practice

Imagine that you're sorting a box of toys by their height. 

You decide to take another empty box and insert toys into it one by one, but maintain the order as you do it.

If T is the number of toys you have, the time complexity of this task is O(T).

What is the space complexity?

???

- O(T)
- O(1)
- O(logT)
- O(TÂ²)
