# Don't Just Jump into Coding

---
## Content

Coding questions tend to be vague and *underspecified on purpose* to allow the interviewer to gauge the candidate's attention to detail and *attentiveness*.

> ðŸ’¡ Don't rush. Be methodical. Clarify your assumptions until the interviewer gives you the green light to start coding. 

---

#### Understand what's being asked

Paraphrase and repeat the question back to the interviewer to make sure you are clear on what to solve.

---

#### Clarify assumptions

Build a clearer picture of the problem to understand what's being asked of you and what's already presumed. 

Think of questions like: 

- *How is the data provided to me?*
- *What's the longest string I can expect?*
- *Should I account for negative values?*

---

#### Confirm with a few examples

Before diving in, work through a simplified example of the problem to make sure you know what's being asked.

Imagine you're asked to write a palindrome checker. Before coding, come up with simple test cases like `"ROTATOR" => true`, `"TIGER" => false`. Then check with the interviewer if those example cases align with their expectations. Don't forget about edge cases like `""` and faulty values like `null`.

---

> ðŸ’¡ These tips are valid for take-home interviews too! You should always understand the problem first before trying to solve it. 

---
## Practice


Imagine you're on a call with an interviewer and they open a Google Doc and write out the following problem:

```js
// given an array of nums and another target num
// return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
```

What's an example of a good question to ask?

???

- all the other answers
- how big is the array?
- are the numbers integers?
- can the numbers be negative?
- is there more than one solution?
- can I use the same element twice?

## Revision


Imagine you're on a call with an interviewer and they open a Google Doc and write out the following problem:

```js
// given an array of nums and another target num
// return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
```

What is something you should probably **NOT** do straightaway?

???

- jump into coding
- clarify assumptions
- write out a few examples
- understand the input data better
