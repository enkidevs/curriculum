# General vs Specialized Interviews

---
## Content

Typically, companies require good knowledge of fundamental CS topics like data structures and algorithms[1] as well as proficiency in at least one programming language.

If you're applying for a more specialized job like a front-end developer, the focus might be more on your web dev knowledge[2].

How much focus is put on general versus specialized knowledge depends on the role and on the company size.

Startups tend to focus more on specific knowledge as they need you to be productive from the start while big companies require strong fundamentals and can afford to train you for the specialized role once you join.

> ðŸ’¡ Strive to become a mix of both, where you're great in your own field but also have general knowledge of other fields. This is usually called a T-shaped developer.
