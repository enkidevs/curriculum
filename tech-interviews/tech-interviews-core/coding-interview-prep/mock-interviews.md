# Mock Interviews

---
## Content

Interviewing is a skill, and like any other skill, you can get better at it with practice.

Ideally, you should rehearse the steps outlined across this course until they become second nature to you.

A great way to practice is with a friend, taking turns to interview each other.

If that's not an option for you, there are a few sites that can pair you with others to practice real interviews:

#### interviewing.io

This website provides anonymous practice technical interviews with Google and Facebook engineers, which can lead to real jobs and internships. 

If you do well in the mock interviews, you'll unlock the jobs page which allows you to book interviews (anonymously) with top companies like Uber, Lyft, Quora, Asana and more.

Since the interview process is anonymous, it's more objective and less stressful.

#### 2. Pramp

Pramp's approach is slightly different. It pairs you up with another peer who is also a job seeker, and both of you take turns to assume the role of interviewer and interviewee.

Pramp also prepares questions for you, along with suggested solutions and prompts to guide the interviewee.

One drawback of this platform is that your experience is heavily reliant on the person you are matched with.
