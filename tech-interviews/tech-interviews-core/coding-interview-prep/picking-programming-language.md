# Picking a Programming Language

---
## Content

It's essential to pick a suitable programming language early in your interview preparation and use it regularly when practicing.

> 💡 Most companies let you choose any[1] language you want for coding interviews.

---

#### 🧠 Stick to the language you know the best

Languages take time to master. Rather than spending tens of hours learning a new language, it's wiser to spend your time solving practice problems and learning algorithms and data structures.

> 📣 We'll deep-dive into the fundamentals of those soon!

#### ⚖️ Pick a language that does more with less code

If you're not comfortable in any particular language, learn one that lets you move fast and be effective.

> 💡 You want to spend your time solving the problem without needing to write long words and statements.

---

#### ⌨️ Java, Python or JavaScript are popular choices

C++ and Java are old-school favorites. They provide standard libraries you can lean on to move faster but they can also be verbose[2] or make you work more to do simple things.

Modern languages like Python and JavaScript are popular choices these days due to their succinct syntax and rich ecosystem of libraries. But keep in mind that they can be quirky![3].

> 🌟 Check out our courses in [Python](https://app.enki.com/skill/python), [JavaScript](https://app.enki.com/skill/javascript) or [Java](https://app.enki.com/skill/java) to level up in time for your interview.

## Practice

When picking a programming language, which one of these is **NOT** a great reason to learn a new language:

???

- you want to use a trendy language
- you're bored with existing tech
- you want to impress the interviewer
- all the other answers

## Footnotes

[1: Some jobs require specific languages]

If you're applying for a domain-specific position, such as a front-end, iOS or Android engineer, you'll have to choose from specific languages on those platforms: JavaScript, Swift, Java, Kotlin, etc.

[2: Java is verbose for interviews]
Java is verbose compared to other languages, meaning that you have to write more (or a lot more) code to perform the same task as in another language. 

For example, here's "Hello World" in Java and in Python:

```java
class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");  
    } 
} 
```

```python
print("Hello World") 
```

[3: Languages have different behaviors]
If a language doesn't support a particular data structure, ask the interviewer if you can assume it exists so you can focus on the meat of the problem. But make sure you can understand the space/time complexities of that data structure if it comes up. More on this in the next workout!
