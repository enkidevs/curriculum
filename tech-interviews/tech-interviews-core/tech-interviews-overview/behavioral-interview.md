# Behavioral interview

## Content

The goal here is to get a sense of how you react to stress, what your personality is like, and how you conduct yourself at work.

Be honest but strategic in your approach. You should demonstrate what happened and what you did as a result.

A common answering technique to use for these is the STAR method. Let's run through an example.

--- 

### ⭐ STAR Method

> 💡 STAR stands for: Situation, Task, Action, Result.

Here's a sample question:

*"Tell me about a time you were new to a job or school. How did you adapt?"*

---

#### 📋 Situation: Set the scene

*"When I started my last job, I had never worked as a full-time software engineer and knew I had a lot to learn."*

---

#### 🗳️ Task: Describe your responsibility in that situation

*"Everyone seemed to know what they were doing, and I felt somewhat lost, so I decided to put in extra time and effort to adjust to my new role."*

---

#### 💪 Action: Explain the steps you took to address it

*"I made sure to read the team docs, ask questions from senior coworkers, and take notes about what I learned. On the weekends, I spent a few hours learning Python online."*

---

#### ✅ Result: What outcomes did your actions achieve

*"Six months into the job, I became comfortable with the codebase and shipped my first feature. It was a button you press to receive an invoice for your order!*
