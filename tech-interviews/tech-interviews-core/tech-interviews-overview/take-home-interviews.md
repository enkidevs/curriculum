# Take-home Interviews

---
## Content

Take-home interviews are mini work projects that can take several hours to a few days to complete ðŸ•Ÿ. 

The great thing about them is that you can work on them from the comfort of your home or your favorite coffee shop - with no one looking over your shoulder.

The flip side is that take-home tests are usually difficult and will take a while to complete!

> ðŸ’¡ Start as soon as you can to give yourself time for any surprises or delays.

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips

The most important aspect of a take-home project is that your solution is correct and clear to whoever reviews it.

- Focus on **building a working prototype quickly**, then work on improving it and handling any edge cases. 

- **Take notes and add documentation**. It's important to know how to run your project but also understand your thinking and design choices.

- If you don't complete the project, **document the attempts you took**. An honest effort will still count for something.

- **Remember to make your code easy to follow**. Use formatting, clear names, common patterns and best practices.

- If you have time, **add an extra feature or a visual demo** to stand out and show your passion for the job.

## Practice

After reading the requirements for a take-home task, you get an idea for a cool animation you can add that wasn't asked for, but you think it would make you stand out.

You remember seeing an animation library in a blog post and are eager to start researching the animation API to learn how to use it.

When is the best moment to start working on that?

???

- only after satisfying the main requirements
- before doing anything else
- whenever you feel like it
