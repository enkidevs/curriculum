# Tech Interview Structure

---
## Content

Although the details vary across companies and countries, the core of any technical interview is split into two parts:

#### 1. ðŸ’» Coding test

The coding test covers your coding and problem-solving skills. Most of the time it's done in two steps: 

1. a phone call or online assessment using a word editor or a coding interview site. 
2. The second (and typically final) step is a whiteboard interview[1] or a take-home assignment[2].

#### 2. ðŸ§  Behavioral test

This part is more company-specific but generally focuses on your soft skills. For example - how would you behave in situations that require the ability to handle conflict or challenges.

The rest of this workout will cover some key tips for every type of interview or test you might expect.

## Footnotes

[1: Whiteboard Interviews]
A whiteboard interview takes place in the interviewing company's office. It typically involves writing code and sometimes diagrams on a whiteboard while the interviewing team observes and asks you further questions. They usually take 2-4 hours.

[2: Take home test]
A take-home interview is a mini-project a company asks you to complete. The goal is to make the interview more realistic and similar to the actual job. The time you spend ranges from 3 hours to multiple days.
