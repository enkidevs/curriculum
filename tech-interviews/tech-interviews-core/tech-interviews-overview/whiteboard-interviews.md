# Whiteboard Interviews

---
## Content

In a typical whiteboard interview setting, you solve a problem on the spot by writing code or drawing diagrams on a whiteboard. Then the interviewing team observes and asks you follow-up questions.

> ðŸ’¡ Some companies might ask you to bring your own laptop to code on, so make sure to prepare your dev environment if that's the case.

The interviewers want to see how you approach a problem you haven't seen before, as well as how you collaborate with colleagues, and troubleshoot if you hit a roadblock. 

If you feel stuck or make a mistake, don't worry! 

**Take a deep breath, ask questions, and, most importantly, explain your thought process out loud.**

> ðŸ’¡ The interviewers are often more interested in learning how you approach a problem than whether you solve it successfully. 

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips

Buy a whiteboard and **simulate the whole experience at home**. 

Practice using the whiteboard space efficiently and thinking aloud when solving the questions.

The point is to have a productive back-and-forth with your interviewer.

There are also websites out there that let you practice mock interviews online.[1]

> ðŸ’¡ Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.
