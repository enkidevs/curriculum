## Content

Here's a visualization to help you see how Big-O estimates efficiency as the size of the input data increases.

> ðŸ’¡ When estimating Big-O, think about what happens when N grows by a lot.

The X axis is the number of elements N, and the Y axis is the number of operations it would take to process N elements:
