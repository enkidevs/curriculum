# Common Big-Os: O(1), O(N), O(NÂ²)

---
## Content


#### O(1) â†’ Constant Time

O(1) means your program will take the same amount of steps for 1 item and 1 million items.

#### O(N) â†’ Linear Time

O(N) means your program will take (at most) 100 steps for 100 items.

#### O(NÂ²) â†’ Quadratic Time

O(NÂ²) means your program will take (at most) 10,000 steps for 100 items.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the above example is actually O(F*P) where F is the number of fruit and P is the number of people. That's still quadratic time.
