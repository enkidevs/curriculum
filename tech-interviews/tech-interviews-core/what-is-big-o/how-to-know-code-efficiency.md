# Hacking code efficiency

---
## Content

Welcome to the start of the course which will help you with problems you might get asked during interviews!

> ðŸ’¡ Along with Arrays, Maps, Lists, and Trees, Big-O will give you a great foundation for language-agnostic problem-solving.

When solving coding interview problems, the ideal solution is correct, fast and uses as little memory as possible.

At a job, you might download perf-measuring software and estimate your program's performance in different scenarios.

In an interview, there's not enough time to do that, plus you might be solving the problem in real time.

A standard technique you can use instead is called the Big-O Notation.

The next two workouts are all about how to quickly gauge the efficiency of your code and be confident that you found the optimal solution for a given problem.

> ðŸ’¡ Some companies might not directly ask you about Big-O. Nonetheless, they still want you to write the most efficient solution. Applying the thinking behind Big-O lets you quickly gauge code efficiency without much work.
