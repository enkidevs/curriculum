# What is TypeScript?

---
## Content

If you're old enough, you might remember when JavaScript was just a web development language. 

Due to its versatility, JavaScript is now used in a wide range of applications, like neural network design, server building and many more[1].

You're probably thinking: "What's JavaScript got to do with it -- isn't this a TypeScript course?". Let us explain!

Because of the popularity of JavaScript, many tools were created to further expand its capabilities. TypeScript is one of those.

TypeScript is a **strict superset[2] of JavaScript with optional types**.

This means that TypeScript has and always will have all the functionality of JavaScript with the option of using types where needed.

Anything that you can build with JavaScript you can also build with TypeScript.

## Footnotes

[1: JavaScript is incredibly versatile]

Here are some tools to demonstrate what can be built with JavaScript:
  - [Develop ML models](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
  - [Build User Interfaces](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [Make iOS and Android apps](https://reactnative.dev)
  - [Build servers](https://nodejs.dev)

[2: Superset]
A set `X` is a superset of set `Y`, if `X` includes all the values in `Y`.

For example, the set `"Fruit"` includes all possible `"Apples"`. This means that `"Fruit"` is a superset of `"Apples"`.
