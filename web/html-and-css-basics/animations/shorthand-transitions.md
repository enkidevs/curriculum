# Shorthand Transitions

---
## Content

Declaring each transition property individually can be intensive, especially using `vendor prefixes`. 

Instead, try the shorthand property `transition` that supports all the different values. 

Using only this alone it is possible to set every transition value in order of `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and lastly `transition-delay`.


```
.box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition: background .2s linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

For setting many transitions at once, set every individual group of transition values, then use a comma to separate each group of additional ones.
