# Margin and Padding

---
## Content

Both properties are, alongside `border`, part of the **box model**. They are usually used to help with positioning and visibility.

Different browsers may have different default values for elements, so specifying them yourself might be a good idea.

### Margin
The `margin` property sets the amount of space that surrounds an element, outside its `border`. They are used for *positioning* the element inside a page and distancing it from other elements. 

Like `border`, margins can be set individually:
```
div{ 
  margin-top:20px;
  margin-left: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```
Or using the shorthand notation:
```
div{
/* same value for top and bottom
   and left and right */
  margin: 20px 10px;
/* values for top, right, bottom 
   and left */
  margin: 20px 5px 15px 10px;
}
```

### Padding

The `padding` property sets the space between the `content` and the `border`, in case of the element having a border. The property is used to provide spacing inside an element:
```
div{
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Unlike `margin`, it will extend the element borders:

On the first line, neither of the rectangles have margin or padding. On the second line, the *green* one has `padding-right:50px`, while the *orange* one has `margin-left:30px`. You can see the difference between the two properties.

Just like margins, you can set individual padding:
```
div{
  padding-top: 30px;
  padding-right: 15px;
}

/* or */
div.special{
  padding: 10px 0px 30px 5px;
}
```

## Practice

In the `padding` shorthand declaration, which value is the `padding-left`?
```
padding: 10px 0px 13px 5px;
```

## Revision

The ??? property expands the borders of the element, while ??? property pushes it from other adjacent ones.
