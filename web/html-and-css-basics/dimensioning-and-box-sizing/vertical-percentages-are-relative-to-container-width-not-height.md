# Vertical percentages are relative to container width, not height

---
## Content

Width percentage is intuitively calculated based on the width of the container. 

However, percentages on properties like `padding-top` and `margin-top` are also calculated based on the *width* of the container, rather than the height.

```
div {
  height: 100px;
  width:  400px;
  padding-left: 10%; /* = 40px */ 
  padding-top: 50%;  /* = 200px */
}
```

## Practice

What is the `margin-top` value in pixels?
```css
div {
   width: 300px;
   height: 100px;
   margin-top: 10%; 
   /* margin-top: ??? px */
```

* `30`
* `10`
* `100`
* `40`

---
## Revision

Percentages on properties such as *padding-top* and *margin-top* are calculated based on the 

???

* width of the container.
* height of the container.
* perimeter of the container.
* area of the container.
