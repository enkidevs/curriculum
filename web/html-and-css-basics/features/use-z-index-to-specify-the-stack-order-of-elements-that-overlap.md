# Use `z-index` to specify the stack order of elements that overlap

---
## Content

This property can only be used for elements which aren't in the normal stack. For example, those with a `position` value which is not `static` (default). 

Elements with a higher `z-index` value will appear on top of elements with a lower `z-index` value.

```css
img {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  /* negative values are accepted */ 
}

div.a {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

In the above example, the image will appear to be under the `div` element if they overlap.

---
## Practice

Which of the following elements will be displayed on top?
```css
#A {
 position: absolute;
 z-index: 10;
}
#B{
 position: absolute;  
 z-index: -10;
}
#C {
 position: absolute; 
 z-index: 0;
}
```
???

* `A` 
* `B` 
* `C` 
* They are all on the same level.
