# Flexbox `flex-wrap`

---
## Content

`flex-wrap` defines whether the flex items are forced in a **single line** or can be **flowed into multiple lines**. If set to multiple lines, it also defines the cross-axis which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.


`nowrap` (default): single-line which may cause the container to overflow.

`wrap`: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction.

```
.flex-container {
  flex-wrap: wrap;

`wrap-reverse`: multi-lines, opposite to direction defined by flex-direction.


```
.flex-container {

## Practice

Which of the following values will potentially overflow the container?
```
.flex-container{
 flex-wrap: ???;
}
```

* `nowrap`
* `wrap`
* `wrap-reverse`
* `unset`

---
## Revision

Which of the following Flexbox definitions is the definition for *wrap*?

???


* Multi-lines where the direction is defined by flex-direction.
* Multi-lines, opposite to the direction defined by flex-direction.
* Single-line which could cause the container to overflow.
