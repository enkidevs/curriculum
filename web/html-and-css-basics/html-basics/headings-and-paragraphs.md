# Headings and Paragraphs

---
## Content

Even the simplest of web pages must contain at least one block of text. Usually, these fields are semantically delimited by the `<h>` and `<p>` tags.
```html
<head>
  ...
<head>
<body>
  <h1>Page title </h1>
  <h3>Subtitle </h3>
  <h6>The smallest of the headings </h6>
  <p>The first paragraph of the page </p>
  <p>The second paragraph </p>
</body>
```
In a browser, the above code looks like this:

The difference between *headings* and *paragraph* is that the former are inherently bold. While a `<h4>` element has the same font size as `<p>`, `<h6>` is almost one third smaller.

Each of these elements occupy a whole line, and the spacing between them is constant, even when nested:
```html
<body>
 <p>Main paragraph.
   <p>Nested paragraph.</p>
   <p>A second nested paragraph.</p>
 </p>
 <p>Another main paragraph.</p>
</body>
```
Which looks like this:

This behavior is specific to **block elements**.
