# Hyperlinks

---
## Content

**Hyperlinks** represent a way to tell the browser to move up or down the page (think of content summaries) or to load other HTML documents.

They are semantically separated by the `<a>` tag. Because of how they work, every hyperlink must have the `href` attribute, which takes a path of where to go next as an argument which is represented as a string:
```html
<a href="contact.html">
    Contact
</a>
```
The main difference between `<p>` and `<a>` elements is that you can click on hyperlinks. To visually represent that ability, their default color is *blue* and they are *underlined*.

The default placeholder for the `href` attribute is `#`. In this case, after clicking the hyperlink, nothing will happen.
```html
<a href="#">Empty href</a>
```
