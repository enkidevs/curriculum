# CSS Declaration

---
## Content

A CSS file is made up of *selectors* (a way of pointing to the HTML elements to be changed) and *declarations* (a property and value pair).

The syntax for a CSS *declaration* is:
```
background-color: red
```
The property we are looking to change is `background-color`. The `:` separates the two entities, and `red` is the new property value.

Every *declaration* has to be located inside a *block*:
```
{
  background-color: red
}
```
Multiple declaration can be grouped inside a block. In this case, semicolons, `;` are required after each declaration:
```
{
  background-color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
The above snippets made some changes, but CSS doesn't know which elements they are referring to. *Selectors* are used to specify those elements:
```css
p{
  background-color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
`p` is a type selector. Whatever CSS rule you apply to `p` in this example, it will affect all instances of `<p>` elements in the HTML document.
