# Floating Elements

---
## Content

Another way to position elements on page is with `floats`. This property allows elements to be positioned to the left or right side of the parent element. All other elements will flow around the floated element.

One use-case is floating an image to the side of a block of text, as the text will surround the image:
```
#imageleft{
  float: left;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
}
#imageright{
  float: right;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
p{
  font-size: 30px;
  font-color: #ffffff;
}
```

It can also be used to align elements to the side of the last one:
```
.elem{
  width: 120px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 15px;
}
.leftelem{
  float: left;
}
.rightelem{
  float: right;
}

```
And the HTML:
```html
<div class="elem leftelem">Left</div>
<div class="elem leftelem">Left</div>
<div class="elem leftelem">Left</div>
<div class="elem rightelem"
  id="first-right-elem">Right</div>
<div class="elem rightelem">Right</div>
<div class="elem rightelem">Right</div>
```

However, this might not be the layout we were looking to achieve. As there is space left for 2 more rectangle on the first line, `float:right` will position them in the empty space.

To push all right floating elements on the next line, we have to use a property called `clear`. This property doesn't allow any `float` elements to the side specified by its value. The three most used values are: `left`, `right` and `both`.

Because we want the first right element to start on a new line, we have to `clear` floating elements to the left of it:
```
#first-right-elem{
  clear:left;
}
```
And the result will be:
