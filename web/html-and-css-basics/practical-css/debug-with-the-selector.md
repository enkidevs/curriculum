## Content

These three lines of **CSS** will select every element on the page and give them a slightly darker background color with the help of the `*` selector.
```css
* {
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

Elements inside other elements will get darker and darker.

This approach is useful when dealing with box models and when wanting to see how `padding` and `margin` affect each other.

This is how 3 nested `div`s would look:
