## Content

`inherit` takes an extra step in checking whether there are other properties it can use in the cascade before using the `initial` value that has been set.

For example:

```css
h1 {
  color: /* initial or inherit */; }
body {
  color: olive; }
:root {
  color: black; }
```
With `initial`, `h1` is required to use `initial` value, so it bypasses the `body` element and goes to the `root`.

With `inherit`, `h1` is required to `inherit` a color which it takes from `body`, giving it a color of `olive`.

*Note*: `:root` is a pseudo-class that refers to the highest-level ancestor in the DOM. For webpages, using `:root` is the same as using `html`. However, because CSS can be used for styling `SVG` and `XML` as well, it might have a different meaning sometimes.
