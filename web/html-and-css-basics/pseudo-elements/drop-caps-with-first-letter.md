# Drop caps with `::first-letter`

---
## Content

Using the `::first-line` and `::first-letter` pseudo elements that have been  introduced in CSS1, a nice typographic effect like a drop cap can be achieved.

```css
p::first-letter {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```
This will only work if the  first letter is not preceded by another pseudo-element  such as `::before`.

If there are multiple targeted elements in a row, each first letter will be affected. In order to avoid this `::first-child` or `::first-of-type` pseudo-elements can be used:
```css
p::first-child::first-letter {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```
The first line of a text can also be enhanced:
```css
p::first-line {
  font-size: 15px;
}
```
An usage example of the pseudo-elements:

## Practice

Change the size of the first letter of a paragraph to `50px` :
```css
p.special ??? {
  ??? : 50px;
}
```

* `::first-letter` 
* `font-size` 
* `::first-child:first-line` 
* `size` 
* `font-height`

---
## Revision

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element won't have the expected result if the targeted element 

???.


* has a `::before` pseudo-element set
* has an `::after` pseudo-element set
* is not a paragraph
