```true
background-attachment
%exp
This property specifies how to move the background relative to the viewport.
%

background-repeat
%exp
This property specifies how (and if) the background will repeat.

%

border-spacing
%exp
The border-spacing value is also used along the outside edge of the table, where the distance between the table's border and the cells in the first/last column or row is the sum of the relevant (horizontal or vertical) `border-spacing` and the relevant (top, right, bottom, or left) `padding` on the table.
%

bottom
%exp
The `bottom` property in CSS goes hand in hand with positioning. By default, elements are static positioned in which the `top` property has no effect whatsoever. But when the positioning of an element is `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`, the `bottom` value plays a big role.
%

caption-side
%exp
It allows you to define where **HTML**’s caption element will be positioned.
%

clip
%exp
`clip` is used on background and it allows you control how far a background image or colour extends beyond the element’s `padding`.

%

margin

%

max-width
%exp
This allows you to set the **max** `width` to which an element can grow.
%

orphans
%exp
When printing a page, `orphans` property controls the minimum number of lines of a paragraph allowed to be left on the old page, while the rest of the text is printed on a new page.

It won’t affect the position of the element.
%

overflow
%exp
The `overflow` property controls what happens to the content that breaks outside of its bounds.
%

%

widows
%exp
In the paged media, in the event of a paragraph splitting on two pages, the `widows` property controls the number of lines to be printed on the next page.
%

z-index
%exp
The `z-index` property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap, as in which one should appear closer to the user.
%

```

```false
font-face
%exp
CSS supports a property called `@font-face`, but here the @ is missing so the property is invalid.
