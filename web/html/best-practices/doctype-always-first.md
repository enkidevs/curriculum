# Doctype - always first
---
## Content

In every HTML web page, the very first thing line of code should always be the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.

This is because the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used to tell the browser what type of HTML document it is rendering.

For HTML5 the declaration is typed as:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
