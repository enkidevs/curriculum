# Doctype - always first
---
## Content

In every HTML web page, the very first line of code should always be the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.

This is because the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used to tell the browser what type of HTML document it is rendering.

For HTML5 the declaration is typed as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

**Note:** The DOCTYPE tag is *not* an HTML element, but a tag specific for browsers to identify the type of code in the document.
