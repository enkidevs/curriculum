# .html vs .htm
---
## Content

`.html` and `.htm` are both file extensions for HTML.

The only difference is that `.htm` was used in the early days when operating systems like DOS did not support file extensions past 3 characters. 

There was no 3 character limitation for early Mac users, so they often used the full `.html` extension when Unix systems (even the web servers) still had to use `.htm` creating some technical problems. 

Today, limiting extensions to 3 characters is no longer necessary on any operating system.
