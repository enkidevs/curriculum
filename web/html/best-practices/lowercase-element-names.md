# Lowercase element names

## Content

In HTML5 it is not mandatory to write in lowercase. However, it is encouraged.

This is because being consistent in writing lowercase makes your code more readable.

Also, some developers don't use HTML5. Instead they use XHTML or XML which require stricter coding. So if you want other developers who don't use HTML to read your web page, it is best practice to write in lowercase.

## Practice

For what reason is HTML encouraged to be written in lowercase?

???

* Easier to read
* Code doesn't work in Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters take up less space
* It is not just encouraged it is also mandatory
