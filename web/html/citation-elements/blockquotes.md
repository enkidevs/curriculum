# Blockquotes
---
## Content

The HTML `<blockquote>` element or the **Block Quotation** element is used to enclose text which represents an extended or long quotation. This element is displayed as a block element and usually has a 1em top/bottom margin added by default, as well as a left/right indentation of 40 pixels. Of course, this is all editable with CSS styling.

Example:
```html
<blockquote>
 Every revolutionary idea seems to
 evoke three stages of reaction.<br>
 They may be summed up by the phrases:<br>
 It's completely impossible.<br>
 It's possible, but not worth doing.<br>
 I said it was a good idea all along.<br>
- Arthur C. Clarke
</blockquote>
```

Blockquotes can be used with the citation element `<cite>` to share the source, but it is important that there is also visible attribution as well.

If you wish to add a short quote to your web page or document, you should use the `<q>` or the **Quotation element**.
Example:
```html
<q>I have a dream!</q>
- Martin Luther King
```
