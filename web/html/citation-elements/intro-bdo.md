# bdo Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<bdo>`, or the **Bidirectional Text Override** element, is used to override the current directionality of text. This means that you can have text written in one direction, render and display in the opposite direction.

This element has 2 element related attributes, `ltr` and `rtl`.
 - `ltr` sets the text direction to Left-to-Right.
 - `rtl` sets the text direction to Right-to-Left.

Example with one word:
```html
<p>
  Play
</p>
<p>
  <bdo dir="rtl">Play</bdo>
</p>
```
Single Word Result:

![bdo-play](%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2286%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2286%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%23000%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2218%22%20y%3D%2231%22%3EPlay%3C%2Ftspan%3E%20%20%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2218%22%20y%3D%2265%22%3EyalP%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

Using this element is very useful for content presented in multiple languages. For instance, if you have a text that you want to be displayed in Arabic or Hebrew, next to translating the text, you would also use the `<bdo>` element along with its `rtl` attribute to make the text go Right-To-Left and become readable.

**Note:** It's also interesting that when text in English is written Right-To-Left in a web page, and the text is copied and pasted elsewhere by a user, that text will be displayed in regular Left-To-Right. This is because the text only appears Right-To-Left because of the HTML code, and without it, the text will display as written.
