# The `<cite>` Element

---
## Content

The HTML `<cite>` element is used to describe a reference of a cited **creative work**. This element needs to contain either the title or the URL of the cited work.

What falls under creative work:

- Any online content
- Any book
- Any computer program
- Any original writing
- Any exhibition
- Any video
- Any legal writings
- Any original artwork
- Any research paper

```

![cite](https://img.enkipro.com/28852f600f281af9f98989e02b4471bc.png)

The cited URL under the `<cite>` element will, by default, display in <i>italic</i>. However, this is easily editable by adding the `font-style` CSS property to the `<cite>` element and changing the default value to 'normal' or even 'oblique' (aka bold).
