# The cite Element


---

## Content

The `<cite>` element is used to describe a reference of a cited **creative work**. This element needs to contain either the title or the URL of the cited work.

What falls under creative work:

- Online content
- Books
- Computer programs
- Original writing or artwork
- Exhibitions
- Videos
- Legal writings
- Research paper

```html
<p>
  More information about Enki here
  <cite>
    [https://enki.com/about]
  </cite>.
</p>
```

![cite](https://img.enkipro.com/28852f600f281af9f98989e02b4471bc.png)


By default, the URL under the `<cite>` element will display in *talic*. However, this is easily editable by adding the `font-style` CSS property to the `<cite>` element, and changing the default value to "normal" or even "oblique" (aka **bold**).
