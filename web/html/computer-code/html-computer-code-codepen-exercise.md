## Content

In this exercise, you will work with **four semantic HTML elements** used to represent different types of code-related text:  
- `<kbd>` for user input (like keyboard shortcuts)  
- `<var>` for variables in code or math  
- `<samp>` for sample output from a system or program  
- `<code>` for code snippets  

Use the correct element for each sentence, and nest elements together where appropriate (for example, `<kbd>` inside `<code>`).  

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- `<kbd>` is for keyboard inputs like **Ctrl + Z**.  
- `<var>` is used for variables like `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.  
- `<samp>` is for output text like error messages.  
- `<code>` is for code references like `calculateSum()`.  
- You can nest elements if needed:  
```html
  <code><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd></code>
```
