# Display Code in HTML
---
## Content

The HTML `<code>` element is used to display a fragment of a computer code.

Example:
```html
<p>
  The function
  <code>
    calculateAverage()
  </code>
  calculates the average
  of a set of numbers.
</p>
```

Code Result:

The default font style for the `<code>` element for most browsers is the monospace font.

**Note:** It's best to use the `<code>` element to style content for HTML elements, CSS rules, filenames, and JS scripts. With a little CSS, the code used can stand out more on a page like this:

## Quiz

### How much do you know about the `<code>` element?

What will be the effect of wrapping this text in the _code_ element?
```html
<code>
  var x = 5;
  y = x == 10
</code>
```

* All text within `<code>` will display in monospace font.
* Only the text "var x = 5;" will be displayed within the page because the other line has no semicolon.
* All text within `<code>`, will display in arial font.
* All text within `<code>` will display with syntax highlighting associated with the coding language.
