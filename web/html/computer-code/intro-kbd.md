# `<kbd>` - Keyboard Input Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<kbd>`, or the **Keyboard Input** element, is used to represent user input, such as keys on a keyboard, voice commands, or any other textual input.

Example:
```html
<p>
  On a Mac, use the keys:
  <kbd>⌘cmd</kbd> + <kbd>⇧shift</kbd> + 
  <kbd>4</kbd> to take a screenshot of a selected area.
</p>
```

Keyboard Input Result:

The default font style for the `<kbd>` element for most browsers is the monospace font.

By adding CSS styles, the `<kbd>` element can be used to present the user input in much better ways.
