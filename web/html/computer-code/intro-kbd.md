# The kbd Element


---

## Content

The `<kbd>`, or the **Keyboard Input** element, is used to represent user input, such as keys on a keyboard, voice commands, or any other textual input.

```html
<p>
  On a Mac, use the keys:
  <kbd>⌘cmd</kbd> + <kbd>⇧shift</kbd> + 
  <kbd>4</kbd> to take a screenshot of a selected area.
</p>
```

Which looks like this:

For most browsers, the default font style for the `<kbd>` element is the monospace font.

By adding CSS styles, the `<kbd>` element can present user input in a more visually pleasing way.
