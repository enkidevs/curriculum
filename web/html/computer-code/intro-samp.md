# samp - Sample Output Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<samp>`, or the **Sample Output** element, is used to represent a sample output from a computer program.

Example:
```html
<p>This is the crazy error I got:</p>
<p><samp>Keyboard not found<br>
Press F1 to continue</samp></p>
```

Sample Output Result:

The default font style for the `<samp>` element for most browsers is the monospace font.

By adding CSS styles, the `<samp>` element can be used to present the sample output from a computer program in much better ways.
