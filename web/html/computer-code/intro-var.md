# Intro `<var>`

## Content

The HTML `<var>`, or the **Variable** element, is used to represent a name of a variable in either a programming context or a mathematical expression.

Example:
```html
<p><var>X</var> = 10<br>
 <var>Y</var> = 2
<p>As you can see:
 <var>X</var> > <var>Y</var>
</p>
```

Variable Result:

The default text style for the `<var>` element for most browsers is both monospace and italic.

By adding CSS styles, the `<var>` element can be used to present variables in much better ways.
