# Webpage Content Exercise

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Using this [codepen template](https://codepen.io/enkidevs/pen/jOmvWgg), your task is to write HTML code for a webpage that would display:
> - **The largest heading containing the title of the page**
> - **An image of any size. To help your viewers, also add an alternative text message in case the image can't load.**
> - **One paragraph with information about the page.**
> - **A link to another website**

It's up to you to choose the title, the image, what the contents of those paragraphs will be, as well as their color.

Here's one example of how the page could look:

For bonus points, style the paragraphs and/or headings in a different color.

## Footnotes
[1: Hints]

> Here are some examples on how you can style your elements:

Chaining CSS properties together.

```css
<element style="property1:value1;property2:value2">
  Some text
</element> 
```

Styling multiple elements at once:

```css
<style>
element1, element2 {
 property_name: value
}
</style>
```
