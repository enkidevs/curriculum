# Headings (h1-h6)

---
## Content

The HTML heading elements are very important.

They are used to determine the structure of your page.

There are 6 headings in HTML5 ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<h1>` being the most important and largest, `<h6>` being the least important and smallest.

Each heading has a pre set size. However, they are easily modified.

Example:
```
<h1
  style="font-size:60px;">
  Heading 1
</h1>

<h2
  style="font-size:48px;">
  Heading 2
</h2>
```
Result:

<h1
  style="font-size:60px;">
  Heading 1
</h1>

<h2
  style="font-size:48px;">
  Heading 2
</h2>

By default, the `<h4>` heading is the same size as `<p>`.


Search engines interpret headings as part of your page. They use them to display important info for the user.

When users skim through pages, they are mostly looking through headings only. This is why it's important to have at least one heading in your page, and you should always start with `<h1>`.

An `<h1>` heading provides users with easier access to the main content of the page.

It is used in the banner of a web page to describe the website.

Also, it increases readability.
