# Hyperlinks
---
## Content

Hyperlinks are links in HTML. They are very useful for navigating from one document to another. 
By default, un-visited links are blue, highlighted and underlined.
Whereas links you have already clicked on at least once are red.

Hovering over hyperlinks changes the cursor to a pointer.

The hyperlink is defined with the `<a>` tag:
```
<a
  href="URL">Link text
</a>
```
or
```
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/">
  5-minute workouts
</a>
```
Result:
```
5-minute workouts
```

In the example above, the `5-minute workouts` is the hyperlink, and by clicking on the text you are taken to the URL provided in the `href="URL"` attribute.

The attribute `href` is the most important element because it specifies the destination(URL).

Where the link opens is set with the `_target="???"` attribute.

 - _self     = Opens the link in the same tab or window
 - _top      = Opens the link in the full body of the window
 - _parent   = Opens the link in the parent frame
 - _blank    = Opens the link in a new tab or window
 - framename = Opens the link in a named frame

Opening the link in a different tab:
```
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/"
  target="_blank">
  5 minute workouts
</a>
```
**Note:If no target is set, the linked page or document is opened in the current tab.**

You can also create `placeholder` links. These are links that can be clicked, but do nothing.

```
<a
  href="#"> Empty href
</a>
```

Next to linking through text, it is also common to link through pictures.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<a
   href="https://www.enki.com/"
   target="_blank">
  <img
    src ="http.logo.com/enki.png"
    alt ="Enki logo"
    style="width:36px;height:36px;"
   />
</a>

</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the picture with the URL `http.logo.com/enki.png` becomes the link.
