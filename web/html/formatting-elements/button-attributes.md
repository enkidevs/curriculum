### disabled

`disabled` is used to display the button, but disable the button from being pressed by the user. Also, if the button is in a form, or `<fieldset>` element, which has a `disabled` attribute, then the button inherits it.  

### name

`name` is used to give the button a name, and that name is also submitted with the form's data.

### value

`value` is used to set the initial value of the button.

### type

`type` is used to indicate the type of the button. There are 3 possible values:
  - `submit`
  - `reset`
  - `button`

The `type="submit"` is used to submit the forms data to the server. This value is also the default button type if no other value is set for `type`.

The `type="reset"` is used to reset all the values to default in the form the button is associated with.

The `type="button"` has no initial/default behavior. This is used when you want client-side scripts to trigger when events occur.

### form

`form` attribute is used to associate a button to a form. The value of the buttons `form` attribute has to be the same as the `id` attribute of the `<form>` element. This allows you to associate a button to a `<form>` element even though the button is not a direct descendant of that form.
