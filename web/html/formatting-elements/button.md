# Button
---
## Content

The HTML `<button>` element may seem similar to a link `<a>` with a little more default style, but there are key differences:

* Buttons are best used *within* Forms.
* Buttons not used within Forms require JavaScript to have any functionality.

The default `<button>` element looks like this:

```html
<form action="/" method="post">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this case, both the button and the input look and behave the same.

```html
<form action="/" method="post">
  <button>Submit</button>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

The `<button>` element has a slight edge over the `<input>` as both images and text can be placed within it like this:

```html
<button>
  <img src="submit-icon.svg" alt="">
  Submit
</button>
```

**Note:** Buttons have no default action upon click. This is why they are best tied to forms or advanced uses of JavaScript.
