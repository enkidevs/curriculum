# HTML formatting elements exercise

---

## Content

In this exercise, you will:  
1. Add the **same inline element** to a word in each of the 5 sentences.  
2. Add the **CSS classes** (first, second, third, fourth, fifth) from the CSS panel to each inline element so that each word is styled with a different color.  

In the end it should look like this:  
![html-formatting-elements-finished](https://img.enkipro.com/41c83253d42738101d37587f385f2cfe.png)

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Choose an **inline element** like `<span>` to wrap a single word without breaking the text flow.  
- Use the `class` attribute to assign the appropriate CSS class:  
  ```html
  <span class="first">green</span>
```
- Remember that each sentence must use a different class (first, second, third, fourth, fifth).
