## Content

The HTML `<hr>`, or the **Thematic Break** element, is used to create a thematic break between a paragraph of elements. This break is usually represented as a horizontal line and the element itself is a self-closing element, meaning it has no ending tag.

**Note:** In HTML4.01 the `<hr>` element used to represent a horizontal rule, hence the name `hr`, nevertheless that was changed in HTML5 and now it represents a thematic break.

Thematic Break Example:
```html
<h3>Enki App</h3>
<p>
  Enki provides daily workouts.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>EnkiBot</h3>
<p>
  Build your skills and expertise
  with our personalized learning bot.
</p>
```

Thematic Break Result:

Furthermore, the `<hr>` element provides important semantic meaning, such as a change of scenery or a shift of topic. It should not be solely used to add a horizontal line (even though that is possible). To add a horizontal line you should use the appropriate CSS property. 

By default, the `<hr>` element is represented with the following CSS properties:
```css  
hr {
    display: block;
    margin-top: 0.5em;
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    border-style: inset;
    border-width: 1px;
}
```
