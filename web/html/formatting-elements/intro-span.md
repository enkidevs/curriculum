# Intro span

## Content

The HTML `<span>` element is used to style inline HTML elements, meaning that it can style elements that are already on a line with other elements. By itself, the element does not represent any visual change by itself and CSS is required to style it.

**Notes:**  
  - Only use `<span>` if you don't have a more appropriate semantic element.
  - `<div>` and `<span>` are very similar, except `<div>` is a block element, whereas `<span>` is an inline element.

Example:
```html
<p>Normal text here.
  <span>
    Text within span here.
  </span>
  Normal text here.
</p>
```

The above example with HTML alone does pretty much nothing, whereas this example styles the text green based on the properties assigned to the class brand:
```html
<p>Normal text here.
  <span class="brand-color">
  Text within span here.
 </span>
 Normal text here.
</p>
```
