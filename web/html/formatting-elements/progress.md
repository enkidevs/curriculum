## Content

The HTML `<progress>`, or the **Progress Indicator** element, is used to display a progress bar.

Example:
```html
<progress
  value="25"
  max="100">
  25%
</progress>
```

The `<progress>` element has 2 element-specific attributes:
  1. `max`
  2. `value`

The `max` attribute is used to indicate the total work that the progress bars task requires. If the `max` attribute is not present, the default value is set to 1. On the other hand, if you add the `max` attribute, its value has to be 1 or above and be a valid floating point number.

The `value` attribute is used to specify the amount of work that's been completed. The value of the `value` attribute has to either be between 0 and 1 or if `max` is specified, between 0 and `max`. On the other hand, if you don't add the `value` attribute, the amount of work needed to be done is unknown.
