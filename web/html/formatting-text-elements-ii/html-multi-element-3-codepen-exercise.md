# HTML multi element 3

---

## Content

In this exercise, you will add an appropriate element to each sentence:  
1. Make the first sentence small using `<small>`.  
2. Represent the date in the second sentence in a machine-readable format using `<time>`.  
3. Add a line break opportunity using `<wbr>` in the URL in the third sentence.  

In the end it should look like this:

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- `<small>` makes text smaller and less prominent.  
- `<time>` should include a `datetime` attribute for the machine-readable date:  
```html
  <time datetime="2025-08-03">August 3, 2025</time>
```
- `<wbr>` adds a word break opportunity in long strings (like URLs).
