# Intro `<abbr>`


---

## Content

The HTML `<abbr>`, or the **Abbreviation** element, is used to represent an abbreviation. The element has a `title` attribute which can provide a full description of the abbreviation and nothing else.

The content of the title is often shown in a tooltip when a user hovers over the element.  Also, some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element.

```html
<p>
  Learn all about
  <abbr
    title="HyperText Markup Language">
    HTML
  </abbr>
  using Enki.
</p>
```

By default, the `<abbr>` element is displayed as an inline element.

The `<abbr>` element can also be styled with appropriate CSS properties.
