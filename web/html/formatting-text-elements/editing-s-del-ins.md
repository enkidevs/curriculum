### Strikethrough Text

The HTML `<s>`,  or the **Strikethrough Text** element, is used to create a strikethrough in a text. This is usually used to specify that some text is no longer correct or relevant.

Example:
```html
I have $40 left in my account.
I have <s>$40</s> $35 left in my account
```

**Notes:** If you want to indicate a document edit, don't use the `<s>` element, you should use the `<del>` and/or `<ins>` elements instead.

### Deleted & Inserted Text

Next, the `<del>`, or the **Deleted Text** element, is used to specify that some text has been deleted and the `<ins>`, or the **Inserted Text** element, is used to indicate that some text was inserted/added to the document.

Both elements have the same 2 element-specific attributes:
  1. `cite`
  2. `datetime`

The `cite` attribute is used to specify the URL which explains the change.

The `datetime` attribute is used to indicate the time of the change and the date has to be properly specified (YYMMDD), otherwise it won't parse properly and the element won't have a time stamp.

The `<del>` element is usually rendered with strikethrough text, whereas the `<ins>` is usually rendered with underlined text.

```html
<del><p>Old Text</p></del>
<ins><p>New Text</p></ins>
```

## Practice

Cross out the text "$100":

```html
<p>
  Try and get flights under
  <tag>$100</tag> $200!
</p>
```

tag = ???

Display the first list item as deleted text.
Then display the third and fourth items as inserted text.

```html
<ol>
 <li><tag1>Book flights</tag1></li>
 <li>Uber to airport</li>
 <li><tag2>Redeye 11:30pm.</tag2></li>
 <li><tag2>Sleep (if possible).</tag2></li>
</ol>
```

tag1 = ???
tag2 = ???

* s
* del
* ins
* cross
* out
* insert
* delete
* d
* i

## Revision

Match these elements with their meaning:

???: defines text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant.
???: defines text that is replaced or deleted text.
???: defines text that has been inserted.

* s
* del
* ins
* strike
* delete
* cross
* highlight

## Quiz

### How much do you know about formatting text elements?

Mark the false statement:

???

* The `<del>` tag defines elements that are being delayed during the start of an animation.
* Avoid using the `<u>` element where it can be confused with links.
* It is best to use `<ins>` together with `<del>` to properly showcase text updates to a document.
* The `<s>` element that defined strikethrough is used to represent text that is no longer correct.
*  The `<s>` and `<del>` elements visually appear the same by default but have different semantic meaning.
