## Content

In this exercise, you will write **two sentences** using the correct elements:  
- `<b>` for stylistic offset (bold)  
- `<strong>` for important text  

In the end it should look like this:  
![html-b-strong-finished](https://img.enkipro.com/c59844a8272534e77ce9c2c8e63df65e.png)

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- `<b>` is for bold text that is **stylistic only**, not semantically important.  
- `<strong>` is for text that is **semantically important** and usually bolded by default.  
- Example:  
```html
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This is important!
```
