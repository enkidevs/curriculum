# HTML multi element 2

---

## Content

In this exercise, you will write **multiple sentences** using the appropriate elements:  
- `<u>` and `<mark>` for underline and highlighting  
- `<s>` and `<del>` for strikethrough/deleted text  
- `<ins>` for inserted text  

Separate each sentence with a line break `<br>`.  

In the end it should look like this:  
![html-multi-element-2-finished](https://img.enkipro.com/32fd5e4cd4d3ab313ca2307e9df3ebef.png)

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- `<u>` is used for underline and `<mark>` for highlighting.  
- `<s>` and `<del>` indicate text that is no longer relevant or removed.  
- `<ins>` shows newly inserted content.  
- Separate sentences with `<br>`:  
```html
  Sentence one<br>
  Sentence two
```
