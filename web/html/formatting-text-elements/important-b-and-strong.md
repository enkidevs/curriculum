# Important (b & strong)

## Content

The HTML `<b>`, or the ** Bring Attention To** element, is used to bring readers attention to some text and `<strong>`, or the **Strong Importance** element, is used to give importance to some content.

The `<b>` element was also formerly known as the **Boldface** element.

Example:
```html
<p>
  <strong>Warning</strong>:
  The latest
  <b>iPhone</b> is expensive.
</p>
```

The HTML `<strong>` and `<b>` elements appear similar since they both have the same default styling, **bold**, but they both identify the content differently.

Example:
```html
<strong>
  Attention!
</strong>
The floor is
<b>slippery</b>
 and <b>wet</b>!
```
Result:

In the above example, the `<strong>` element is used to specify that the word `Warning` is very important and the `<b>` element is used to give attention to a text `iPhone` without giving it a higher importance.

Rather than wrapping `<b>` or `<strong>` elements around text that is only meant to be used for visually styling purposes, it is more appropriate in those cases to use the CSS property `font-weight:bold;`.
