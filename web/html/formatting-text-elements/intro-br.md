## Content

The `<br>`, or the **Line Break** element, is used to create a line break in a webpage or document. Line breaks can be very useful for writing poems or an address.

```html
Some Text<br>Some Text<br>bla bla
```

**Notes:**
  1) This element doesn't have a closing tag.
  2) Line breaks should never be used to separate paragraphs.
  3) Line breaks should never be used to create larger gaps between lines of text.

When larger visual gaps are needed around blocks of text, the `margin` CSS property should be used (such as `margin-bottom: 24px;`).

Historical, in XHTML the line breaks are written as `<br />` which is important to know if you want to convert your HTML to XHTML or when reading various tutorials.

Address Example:
```html
<p>
Apple<br>
1 Infinite Loop<br>
Cupertino, CA<br>
95014
</p>
```

## Revision

The goal is to display text like this:  
```htmlhtml
Apple
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, CA
95014
```
So what must happen to this address to display as separate lines of text within a single paragraph?
```html
<p>Apple
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, CA
95014</p>
```
???

* Add `<br>`'s to create each new line.
* Add paragraphs to each new line.
* New lines should be created using line-height.
* New lines are not possible within a single paragraph.
* Nothing needs to be done to the code.
