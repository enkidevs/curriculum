The HTML `<dfn>`, or the **Definition** element, is used to specify a term that's being defined within the `<p>`, `<section>` and/or `<dt>`/`<dd>` pairing elements. Also, the `<dfn>` element is usually used to indicate the first use of a term in a document.

```html
<p>
  <dfn>Enki</dfn> is an app
  that provides daily workouts
  for your dev skills.
</p>
```

**Note:** The `<dfn>` elements main purpose is to provide semantic meaning. Other than that, it has no special functionality.

Also, the `<dfn>` element has a `title` attribute. If the `title` attribute is present, the content of the `<dfn>` element, which is the value of the `title` attribute, has to be the term being defined and nothing else.

Furthermore, the `<dfn>` element can have the `<abbr>` element nested inside it. If the `<dfn>` element has a single `<abbr>` element with a `title` attribute nested inside it, then the value of the `<abbr>` elements `title` attribute is the term being defined.

Example with abbr:
```html
<p>
  <dfn>
   <abbr
    title="Hypertext Markup Language">
   HTML
   </abbr>
  </dfn>
  is the standard markup language
  for creating web pages.
</p>

<p>
  After a few hours,
  I was finally able to understand
  <abbr
   title="Hypertext Markup Language">
   HTML
  </abbr>
  !
</p>
```

Abbr Result:
