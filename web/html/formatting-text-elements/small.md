## Content

The HTML `<small>` element, often referred to as `fine print`, is used to change the font size of some text to one size smaller (from large to medium or medium to small, etc.), up to the smallest size the browsers allows.

This element is used for adding short phrases or comments, short blocks of text, a copyright notice, or other legal text.

Example:
```html
<p>Enki is an educational
technology company.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>The content is licensed
under a <a rel="license" href="#">
Creative Commons License</a> and
by using this site, you agree to
our <a href="#">Terms of Use</a>
and our <a href="#">Privacy Policy
</a></small>.</p>
```

By default, the font-size is generally set to .8em smaller than the existing text, which is also often 1 font size smaller. In this example the "Test" text will display at the same size:

```html
<h1><small>Test</small></h1>
<h2>Test</h2>
```
