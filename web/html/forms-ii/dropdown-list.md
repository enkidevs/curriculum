# DropDown List
---
## Content

In HTML, the dropdown list is created with the `<select>` and `<option>` elements combined.

The `<select>` element is used to create a control with a menu of options/items in which each item is represented with the `<option>` element. The value in the first option will display within the drop-down first.

Example:
```html
<form>
<select name="apples">
 <option
  value="green">Green
 </option>
 <option
  value="red">Red
 </option>
 <option
  value="yellow">Yellow
 </option>
</select>
</form>
```

In the example above, we have a dropdown menu with 3 possible options.
You can also set another option item to display pre-selected first, with the `selected` attribute:
```html
<form>
<select name="apples">
 <option
  value="green">Green
 </option>
 <option
  value="red">Red
 </option>
 <option
  value="yellow" selected>Yellow
 </option>
</select>
</<form>
```
