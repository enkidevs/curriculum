## Content

In this exercise, you will create a **dropdown list** about choosing your favorite type of fruit.  

1. Add 5 options: **Apples**, **Bananas**, **Oranges**, **Dragonfruit**, and **Passionfruit**.  
2. Set the **Dragonfruit** option as the default selected option.  

In the end it should look like this:

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `<select>` element to create the dropdown.  
- Use `<option>` for each item in the list.  
- Add the `selected` attribute to the Dragonfruit option so it appears by default.
