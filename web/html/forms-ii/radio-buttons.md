# Radio Buttons
---
## Content

The HTML input form of type `radio` is used to create radio buttons, which are usually held in radio groups. These buttons are rendered as small empty circles that fill in upon selection.

Unlike checkboxes, `radio` buttons can have only one element selected per group. When one button is selected, any button selected before it will immediately be deselected. Of course, this only applies to the radio group where the `radio` button was selected.

**Note: Radio buttons are called `radio` buttons because they look and operate like old-fashioned radios. When a button is pressed, any button pressed before it is pulled out, and you can't have 2 buttons pressed at the same time.**
