## Content

In this exercise, you will create a **form** with:  
1. Two input fields: **Username** and **Password**.  
2. A submit button.  

Requirements:  
- The **labels** for Username and Password should be clickable to focus the input fields.  
- Each input field should have a **placeholder**.  
- Make the form **un-submittable** until both fields are filled out using the `required` attribute.  
- Add a **keyboard shortcut** to the submit button using the letter `"s"`.  

In the end it should look like this:

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use `<label for="username">` and `<input id="username">` to link labels and inputs.  
- Use `<input type="text">` for the username and `<input type="password">` for the password.  
- Add the `required` attribute to both inputs so the form can't be submitted empty.  
- Use the `accesskey` attribute on the submit button:  
```html
  <button type="submit" accesskey="s">Submit</button>
```
