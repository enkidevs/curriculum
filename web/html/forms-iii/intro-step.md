The HTML input form `step` attribute is used to specify a *legal* number interval for the `<input>` element.

For instance, if you set `step="4"`, the legal numbers could be -4, 0, 4, 8, etc.

Example:
```html
<form
  action="/action.php">
  <input
    type="number"
    name="points"
    step="4">
  <input
    type="submit">
</form>
```

The `step` attribute is easy to assign with the `number` input and works with any positive floating point value (.1, .5, 1.667, etc). The `step` attribute can also work together with `min` and `max` attributes to create a range of legal values. When a value isn't assigned, it will often start at 0 or the min value.

If you want to accept any value regardless of how many decimal places, you can set the `step` value as `any`.
