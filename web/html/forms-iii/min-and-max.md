# Min and max
---
## Content

The HTML input form `min` and `max` attributes are used to set the minimum and maximum values that can be set. When the user submits the data, an error box will open helping the user spot their mistake.

This works for several input types:
 - date
 - datetime
 - datetime-local
 - month
 - number
 - range
 - time
 - week

Example:
```html
<form
  action="/action.php">
   Enter a date before 2000-01-01:
  <input
    type="date" name="bday"
      max="1999-12-31">

  Enter a date after 1999-12-31:
  <input
    type="date" name="bday"
      min="2000-01-02">

  Rate your experience from 1-5:
  <input
    type="number" name="rating"
      min="1" max="5">

  <input type="submit">
</form>
```
