## Content

The HTML input form attribute `placeholder` is used to display a short hint that describes the expected value for the selected input field. It is displayed in the input field until the user enters a value.

The placeholder attribute works for several input types:
 - `email`
 - `password`
 - `search`
 - `tel`
 - `text`
 - `URL`

Example:
```html
<form
  action="/action.php">
  <input
    type="text" name="full-name"
     placeholder="Full name"><br>
  <input
    type="submit"
    value="Submit">
</form>
```
