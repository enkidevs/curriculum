## Content

The HTML input form `type="password"` attribute is used to display each character either as an asterisk, or a circle. This attribute is very similar to the `type="text"` attribute, but hides each character entered.

Example:
```html
<form
  action="/action.php">
  Username:
  <input
    type="text"
    name="username">
  Password:
  <input
    type="password"
    name="password">
  <input
    type="submit"
    value="Submit">
</form>
```
