# Formaction
---
## Content

The HTML form input attribute `formaction` is used to specify the form-data when a form is submitted by the input element. This submit has to be either a button or an image.

If the `formaction` attribute is specified, it will override the forms `action` attribute.

Example:
```html
<form action="page1.php"
    method="get">
  Name: <input type="text"
    name="name">
  <button type="submit">
    Submit to Page 1
  </button>
  <button type="submit"
    formaction="page2.php">
    Submit to Page 2
  </button>
</form>
```
