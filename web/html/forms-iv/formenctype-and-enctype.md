# Attributes (enctype & formenctype)

---

## Content

The HTML `formenctype` input form attribute is used to specify how form-data should be encoded before it's sent to the server.

It is only used for buttons with `type="submit"` and `type="image"`.

You could also use the `enctype` attribute on the `form` element. This way, you can decide the encoding type for the entire form, instead of specifying it for every `input`.

When using the `enctype` attribute (on the `form` element), its functionality is overwritten by the `formenctype` attribute (on the `input` element) **if both are present within the same form**.

If neither of the attributes are present, the default value is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

When using `<input>` elements with the attribute `type="file"` it is necessary to set the value as `multipart/form-data`.

Setting the value to `text/plain` converts every space to a `+`, but no character is encoded.

Example:

```html
<form
 action="/action_page.asp"
 method="post">
  Name:
   <input type="text"
    name="fname"
    value="StÃ¥le Refsnes">
   <button type="submit">
    Submit with encoding
   </button>
   <button
    type="submit"
    formenctype="text/plain">
    Submit without encoding
   </button>
</form>
```

In the example above we have set all the spaces in the form to convert to a `+` with no character encoding.
