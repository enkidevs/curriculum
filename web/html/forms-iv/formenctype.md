# The `formenctype` Attribute
---
## Content

The HTML `formenctype` input form attribute is used to specify how form-data should be encoded before it's sent to the server.
It is only used for buttons and images with `type="submit"`.

If the attribute is not set, the default value is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

When using `<input>` elements with the attribute `type="file"` it is necessary to set the value as `multipart/form-data`.

Setting the value to `text/plain` converts every space to a `+`, but no character is encoded.

Example:
```html
<form
 action="/action_page.asp"
 method="post">
  Name:
   <input type="text"
    name="fname"
    value="StÃ¥le Refsnes">
   <button type="submit">
    Submit with encoding
   </button>
   <button
    type="submit"
    formenctype="text/plain">
    Submit without encoding
   </button>
</form>
```

In the example above we have set all the spaces in the form to convert to a `+` with no character encoding.
