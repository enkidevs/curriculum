# Form Method
---
## Content

In HTML the `formmethod` form input attribute is used to specify which HTTP method will be used when sending the form-data.

If the `formmethod` attribute is specified it will override the `method` attribute. It can be used with `type="submit"` and `type="image"` attributes.

There are two possible values for the `formmethod` attribute.
 - `method="get"`
 - `method="post"`

The `method="get"` appends form data to the URL when submitted.
The method is useful for when the user wants to bookmark the result.
It is not good to use the `method="get"` for password sensitive information. If passed with this method, the information will be visible in the browsers address bar.

The `method="post"` does not append to the URL, but rather sends the form data as an HTTP post transaction.

Example:
```html
<form
  action="/action.php"
   method="get">
  Full name:
   <input type="text"
     name="fname">
  <input
    type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input
    type="submit" formmethod="post"
    value="Submit using POST">
</form>
```
