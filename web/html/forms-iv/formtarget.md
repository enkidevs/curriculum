# Formtarget
---
## Content

The HTML `formtarget` input form attribute is used to indicate where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
If the `formtarget` attribute is specified it overrides the `target` attribute.

Heres an example of the formtarget attribute set to open in a different window after it's submitted:
```
<form
  action="file.php">
  Name:
    <input type="text"
      name="name"><br>
  <input type="submit"
    formtarget="_blank">
</form>
```

## Practice

Complete the code by adding the appropriate input form attributes to submit the data to a new window.

```
<form
  action="file.php">
  Name:
    <input type="text"
      name="name">
    <br>
  <input type="submit"
    ???="???">
</form>
```
