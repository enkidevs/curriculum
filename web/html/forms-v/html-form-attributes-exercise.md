2. Apply the following attributes:

  - Autocomplete enabled for user convenience.  
  - Allow multiple e-mail addresses in the E-mail input.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `autofocus` attribute on the Full name input.  
- Use the `autocomplete="on"` attribute to enable autofill.  
- Use the `multiple` attribute for the E-mail input so the user can enter multiple addresses.  
- Add a `<button type="submit">` to submit the form.
