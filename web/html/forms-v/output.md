# Output
---
## Content

The HTML `output` element is a container that, when specified, represents a result of a calculation.
It's a container where websites or apps can display their result.

The `output` element has three attributes:
 - `for`
 - `form`
 - `name`

The `for` attribute, which has a value of `element_id`, specifies an explicit relationship between the result of a calculation and the elements that represent the values.

The `form` attribute, which has a value of `form_id`, associates the output with a form. The value of the attribute must equal the `id` of the form element in the same document

The `name` attribute, which has a value of `name`, specifies the name of this element.

Example:
```html
<form
  oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)
    +parseInt(b.value)">
  <input
    type="number"
    name="b"
    value="0" /> +
  <input
    type="number"
    name="a"
    value="5" /> =
  <output
  name="result">5
  </output>
</form>
```

In the example above, there are two input fields and one output field. The input fields have pre-set values of 0 and 5. The two numbers are added together and displayed in the result `output` element which has a pre-set value of 5.

Any time the user changes the value in either of the input fields, the result will change accordingly.
