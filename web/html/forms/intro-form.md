## Content

The HTML `<form>` element is used to represent a section of a document that contains interactive controls for a user to input information, like input text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. This element can automatically create a request to send to a web server, if the right attributes are specified.

The `<form>` element has many attributes, some of them:

- action
- autocomplete
- method
- name
- novalidate

Brief explanation:

The `action` form attribute used to specify where to send the data.

There are two methods used to send the data:
- The `GET` method is used to send the form data encoded within the URL.
- The `POST` method is used to encode the data within the message body of the HTTP request.

The `autocomplete` attribute is used to indicate whether the values for the `input` elements will be automatically completed by the browser and is on by default.

The `name` specifies the name used to identify the form.

The `novalidate` is of type boolean, and when specified indicated that the form should not be validated.


Basic Form Example:
```html
<form action="" method="POST">
  <label
    for="age">Age:
  </label>
  <input
    id="age"
    type="text"
    name="age">
  <input
    type="submit"
    value="Submit">
</form>
```
