## Content

In this exercise, you have two elements: a paragraph and a header.  

You need to add the correct **style attributes** so they match the styling shown in the image below.  

In the end it should look like this:

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `style` attribute directly on each element:  
```html
  <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a paragraph</p>
```
- Set different styles for the paragraph and the header to match the example.
