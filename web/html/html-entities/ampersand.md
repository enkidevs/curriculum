# Ampersand

---
## Content

Some characters in HTML are specially reserved and can only be displayed within a web page by replacing them with special character entities.

An ampersand or the "and" symbol is one of those reserved characters.

To display the ampersand symbol, you can use either the HTML entity *number* or the entity *name*.

HTML Entity Number: 
```html
&#38;
```
Result:
