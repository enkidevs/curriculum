## Content

In this exercise, you will create **2 identical images** using the same cat image URL **(located in `html.index` in the `code` tab)**: 

Then:  
1. Add an `alt` attribute with the text **"Picture of a cute cat"** to both images.  
2. Break the second image by removing `.jpeg` from its URL so the alt text is displayed.  

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `<img>` element with the `src` attribute for the image link.  
- Use the `alt` attribute to display alternative text when the image cannot load.  
- Example:  
```html
  <img src="cat.jpeg" alt="Picture of a cute cat">
```
