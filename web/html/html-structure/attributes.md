# Attributes
---
## Content

In HTML, many elements allow for extra attributes, which allow for additional information to apply to that specific element. Attributes are placed in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs and the values are enclosed in quotation marks.

Example:
```html
<img src="enki_logo.png">
```

In the example above the `src="enki_logo.png"` is an attribute for the `<img>` tag. Without that extra information, the `<img>` element wouldn't know what image to use within it.

The name/value pair refers in this case to 'src' and the value 
'enki_logo.png'. Notice how the value is wrapped in quote marks.
