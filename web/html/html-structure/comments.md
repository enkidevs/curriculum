# Comments
---
## Content

In HTML, you can add notes that will not render within the web page and are useful for yourself and other developers via a comment tag.

Example:
```
<!-- HTML Comment Goes Here -->
```

HTML comments are very useful. They can be used as reminders for what our code does or help us with adding comments when debugging. Instead of removing a block of code, you can just wrap it in a comment and later on decide what to do with it.

Comments are never visible within the website and are only visible in the source code.

Also, comments can be on a single line or span multiple rows.

Example:
```
<!-- Single line comment -->

<!--
<h1 Some header</h1>
<p>Random paragraph.</p>
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com">
  This is a link
</a>
-->
```
