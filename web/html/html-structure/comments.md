# Comments

## Content

In HTML, you can add comments via a comment tag.

Example:
```
<!-- HTML Comment Goes Here -->
```

HTML comments are very useful. They can be used as reminders for what our code does or help us with adding comments when debugging. Instead of removing a block of code, you can just put it in a comment and later on decide what to do with it.

The good thing about comments is they are not rendered by the browser and are only visible in the source code.

Also, comments can span multiple rows.

Example:
```
<!--
<h1 Some header</h1>
<p>Random paragraph.</p>
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com">
  This is a link
  </a>
-->
```
