# HTML elements attributes

## Content

In this exercise, there is a list of 10 HTML terms.  

Correctly sort the list into **elements** and **attributes** and record your answers under the appropriate headings:  

- **h1**  
- **href**  
- **id**  
- **name**  
- **p**  
- **a**  
- **src**  
- **script**  
- **input**  
- **form**  

When you're done, you should have two lists, one for **elements** and one for **attributes**, like in the example[1].

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[2].

## Footnotes
[1: Example]
- Elements: `div, span, img`  
- Attributes: `alt, class, width`  

[2: Hints]
- Elements are the building blocks of HTML (tags like `<p>` or `<a>`).  
- Attributes are values added to elements to define their properties (like `href` or `id`).
