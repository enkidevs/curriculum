## Content

HTML5 has none of the presentational attributes which were used in HTML4. 

This is because handling those functionalities is much more powerful using CSS.

HTML5 also added many new syntactic features that HTML4 doesn't have. Some of these are:

  - `<audio>` and `<video>` tags for natively handling multimedia content
  - track to provide text tracks for the `video` element
  - new structural elements such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
  - embed for plugin content
  - new geolocation features

## Practice

Is this statement true?: HTML5 supports approx. 50% of the presentational attributes that were in HTML4?

???

* No because there are no presentational attributes from HTML4 that are supported in HTML5.
* No, because all presentational attributes from HTML4 are supported in HTML5.
* Yes.
* No, because presentational attributes only existed in HTML1.
