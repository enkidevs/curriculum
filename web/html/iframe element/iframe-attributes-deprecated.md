## Content

These are the last `<iframe>` element-specific attributes. **Note all attributes mentioned below are obsolete**.
  1. `align`
  2. `frameborder`
  3. `longdesc`
  4. `marginheight`
  5. `marginwidth`
  6. `scrolling`

1) The `align` attribute was used to align the `<iframe>` element.

2) The `frameborder` attribute was used to either draw or remove a border for the `<iframe>` element

3) The `longdesc` attribute was used to provide a `URL` as a long description of the `<iframe>` element.

4) The `marginheight` attribute was used to set the space between the top and bottom margins and the content of the `<iframe>` element.

5) The `marginwidth` attribute was used to set the space between the left and right margins and the content of the `<iframe>` element.

6) The `scrolling` attribute was used to provide the browser the ability to either never provide a scroll bar, always provide it, or only when needed.
