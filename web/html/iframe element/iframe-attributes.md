## Content

All attributes will be explained in the next couple of insights. This insight will contain:
  1. `height`
  2. `name`
  3. `src`
  4. `width`

which are also the most used 4 attributes.
    
**Note: The `<iframe>` element also supports global attributes. To learn more about `global attributes` check the `more info` section at the bottom of this insight.**

1) The `height` attribute is used to set the height of the `<iframe>` element. The height is measured in CSS pixels. **Note: Before HTML5 the value of the `height` attribute could've been either in pixels or percentages. Now only in pixels.**

2) The `name` attribute is used to give the `<iframe>` element a name. The value of the `name` attribute can be used as the value of the `target` and `formtarget` attributes for any element using them; like the `<a>`, `<base>`, `<form>`, `<input>` or `<button>` element.

3) The `src` attribute value is the URL of the embedded page. You can also use `about:blank` to embed an empty page.

4) The `width` attribute is used to set the width of the `<iframe>` element. The width is measured in CSS pixels. **Note: Before HTML5 the value of the `width` attribute could've been either in pixels or percentages. Now only in pixels.**
