# Image Alt
---
## Content

All image `<img>` elements are encouraged to use `alt` attributes which specifies alternate text for the image.

Example:
```html
<img src="rainforest.pngrainforest.jpg"
    alt="Beautiful rain forest
         thick with trees">
```

[View CodePen](https://codepen.io/enkidevs/pen/JBjqRb)

In the example above, if for some reason the browser doesn't show the `rainforest.png` image, the `alt` attribute will display the `Beautiful Rainy Forest` text instead.

Using the `alt` attribute is important for every `img` element for page validation and to help support screen readers that will read the text description to those that are visually impaired.

The `alt` attribute can also be left empty and completely valid as this is helpful for indicating that the image is not a key part of the content:
```html
<img src="background-image.png"
      alt="">
```

If your `alt` attribute needs to contain acronyms (like "USA"), you would write it as:
```html
`<img src="usa-map.jpg"
    alt="United States of America map">`
```

The reason is, you want to prevent screen readers from reading any acronyms as single words like "Usa map".

If you really must use acronyms you should add a space after each letter:
```html
`<img src="usa-map.jpg"
    alt="U S A map">`
```
