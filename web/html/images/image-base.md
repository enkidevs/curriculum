## Content

The `<base>` element is used to specify a link path for all relative URL attributes. There can be only one `<base>` element per page or document, and it is written inside the `<head>` element. If more than one `<base>` element is present, only the first `href` and `target` values are used, while the others are ignored.

The `<base>` element cannot be empty, it must contain either the `target` attribute, the `href` attribute, or both of them.

All links in the web page or document are set to open in the same tab:

```html
<head>
   <base
      target="_self">
</head>
```

All links in the web page or document will lead to the `https://www.enki.com` link:
```html
<head>
   <base
    href="https://www.enki.com">
</head>
 ```

All links in the web page or document will lead to the `https://www.enki.com` link, and open in a new tab:
```html
<head>
   <base href="https://www.enki.com"
      target="_blank">
</head>
```

**Note**: In HTML5, the `<base>` end tag has to be omitted. On the other hand, in XHTML it has to be closed.
