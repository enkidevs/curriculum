# Image Height & Width

---

## Content

When working with image sizes, this can seem easy to start with, but it is a little tricky today because of responsive websites. Traditionally, the image size in HTML is set with the `height` and `width` attributes, both values set in pixels.

Example:

```html
<img src="logo.svg"
    height="80"
    width="140">
```

When using the `height` and `width` attributes, the browser will render your page faster and more cleanly.

This is because the browser will reserve appropriate space for the image even before the image is loaded, preventing loading images from forcing changes in the page layout during loading.

To make the images responsive, their height and width can be overridden using CSS.

```html
<img src="logo.svg"
    height="80"
    width="140">
```

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
