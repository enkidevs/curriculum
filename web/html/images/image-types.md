# Image Types

## Content

When using images in your web page or document, whether it's for a logo, an animation, or other, it is important to know which web image formats to use.

These formats are divided into 2 categories:
- **Raster images**
  - JPG/JPEG
  - GIF
  - PNG

- **Vector images**
   - SVG

Raster images consist of a two-dimensional grid of pixels. They do not scale well. If you enlarge or zoom in on a raster image, the quality will decline, and it will look pixelated. Using these images is good for creating photographs or other information-dense images.

Each format is used for different things.

The JPEG/JPG format has millions of colors and is used for still images or photography.

The GIF format has a maximum of 256 colors and is used for simple animations, graphics with flat colors or graphics without gradients.

The PNG divides into two categories.
  - PNG 8
  - PNG 24

The PNG 8 format is similar to GIF. It has a maximum of 256 colors, it has better transparency, but no animation. It's good for icons.

The PNG 24 is similar to PNG 8, except it has unlimited colors and better transparency. Used when transparency is required or when an image needs re-editing and re-exporting.

Vector images are made of thin lines, curves, and shapes, stored in mathematical drawing instructions. Any line or curve can be assigned a different color. Because of this formulaic approach to drawing, no matter how much you zoom in or rescale your image, the resolution stays the same.

SVG format creates images that are very smooth and should be used when creating a logo, an icon, or any other simple image pattern. Also, they are good for displaying an image onto multiple screen sizes.

The SVG image format has unlimited colors and supports transparency.

Graphics that are created in the SVG format are defined by XML. Also, SVG images can be directly inserted into an HTML page as code without being linked to a standalone image file.

**Note: All image formats are animatable by CSS**
