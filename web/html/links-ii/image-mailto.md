# Mailto:

## Content

Although links typically navigate to other pages, using the anchor `mailto:` attribute in the path will open the user's default email program on their computer. 

The link will also auto-load the assigned email address making it easy for user's to quickly send an email.

To create a link to open the user's default email program:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com">
  Email me here
</a>
```

`mailto:` can have four *header fields*: `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, and `body`.

Header fields are added by writing their name followed by an equal sign and the field's value.

> ðŸ’¡ When adding the subject and/or the body, rather than using spaces between words it is recommended to write `%20` in place of each space. This is because URLs have strict syntactic rules[1].

The order of the attributes does not matter. However, when using more than one attribute it is important to separate each of them with a `&` (and) sign.

The main e-mail is always separated with a `?` from the other field values.

To add `cc` to your e-mail:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?cc=person@enki.com">
  Email me here
</a>
```

To add `bcc` to your e-mail:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?bcc=person@enki.com">
  Email me here
</a>
```

To add `subject` to your e-mail:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?subject=This%20is%20the%20subject">
  Email me here
</a>
```

To add `body` to your e-mail:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?body=This%20is%20the%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Email me here
</a>
```

Here is an example with all attributes added on the same link:

```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?cc=person@enki.com&bcc=person@enki.com&subject=This%20is%20the%20subject&body=This%20is%20the%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Email me here
</a>
```

## Footnotes

[1:URL Syntactic Rules]

The reason for replacing spaces with `%20` is because URLs have strict syntactic rules. 

URLs can't have spaces, so the ASCII character for space should be inserted instead. 

The `%` character, followed by two hexadecimal digits, is used to replace unsafe characters from a URL. 

The ASCII character for space is `20`, making `%20` the replacement character for space.

This applies to the `body` part of the e-mail as well. Most of the time, spaces will work, but to make sure they work 100% of the time, replace spaces with `%20`.
