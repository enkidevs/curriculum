## Content

Although links typically navigate to other pages, using the anchor `mailto:` attribute in the path will open the user's default email program on their computer. The link will also auto load the assigned email address making it easy for user's to quickly send an email.

Creating a link to open the user's default email program:
```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com">
  Email me here
</a>
```

The subject area of the email can also be auto loaded.

**Note:** When adding the subject, rather than using spaces between words it is important to write `%20` in place of each space.

Example:
```html
<a
  href="mailto:heya@enki.com?
        subject=Sign%20me%20up!">
Email me to sign up.
</a>
```
