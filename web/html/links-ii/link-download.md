# Download Link


---

## Content

When links connect to web files or images, the page will navigate to that content and display accordingly. But when non-web files or images are linked, those files will be downloaded to the user's computer.  

Example of a non-web download link:

```html
<a href="enki.zip">
Download Zip
</a>
```

Result:

![link-download-zip](https://img.enkipro.com/d6367691bfa0e87ad84cb3dfea9e0903.png)

When web files and images are meant to be downloaded by the user, then the download attribute can be used to force that content to download just like a non-web file or image.   

Example of a web download link:

```html
<a
  href="summary.html"
  download="Today's%20Summary">
Download Web File
</a>
```

Result:

![link-download-web](https://img.enkipro.com/9c4fab090abeaf6fe0195135052edd4e.png)

When the download attribute has a value, it will rename the downloaded file. This can be useful when your file is named `123z12zv824.docx` on your server, but you want it downloaded with something more friendly like `Enki%20Notes.docx`. Keep in mind that `%20` needs to replace any spaces in the filename.

When the value within the download attribute is empty (like `download="">`, then the downloaded file will retain its original filename. Of course, since the file will be a local file for the user, they can always rename that file as they wish, too.
