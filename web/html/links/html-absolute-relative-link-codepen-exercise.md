## Content

In this exercise, you need to write the **absolute** and **relative** paths for a file called `website-logo.png`.  

Scenario:  
- You have a website called `www.some-website.com`.  
- Inside the main directory is a folder called `images` which contains the file `website-logo.png`.  

Your task:  
1. Write the **absolute path** to `website-logo.png` inside the `images` folder.  
2. Write the **relative path** if the image is in the **same folder** as the HTML file.  
3. Write the **relative path** if the image is inside the `images` folder relative to the HTML file.  

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- An **absolute path** contains the full URL including the protocol:  
  `http://www.some-website.com/images/website-logo.png`  
- A **relative path** does not start with `http://` and depends on the current file location.  
- Example relative paths:  
  - Same folder: `website-logo.png`  
  - Images folder: `images/website-logo.png`
