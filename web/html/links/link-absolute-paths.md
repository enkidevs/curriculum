# Absolute Paths
---
## Content

When wanting to link a file or a picture from your website to another website, it must use an absolute link path.

Example link:
```html
<a
  href="http://www.google.com">
  Google
</a>
```

  alt="Apple logo">
```

An absolute path is a full URL to an internet domain and then the appropriate file or picture. Only absolute paths can be used when linking to images/files of another website.

Example of absolute paths:
 - `http://www.adobe.com`
 - `http://www.apple.com/images/logo.svg`
 - `http://www.enkipro.com/help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html`

**Note: For the absolute path link to work, you have to provide the domain name of the website, including the `http:// `.**

There is one downfall when it comes to using absolute link paths. You have no control over these files because they are located on other domains, and if they are moved, your links will break.

What is the biggest downfall to using absolute paths?

???

* You donâ€™t have control over files on other domains and if they are moved, your links will break.
* `contact.html`
* `../services.html`
* `travel/fiji/group-photo.html`
* The paths tend to be longer and add to the filesize of a web page.
* Those paths have lower search engine visibility.
* For downloadable files, absolute paths will not work.
* Relative paths will load the link faster.
