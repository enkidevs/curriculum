# Download Link
---
## Content

When links connect to web files or images, the page will navigate to that content and display accordingly. But when non-web files or images are linked, those files will be downloaded to the user's computer.  

Example of a non-web download link:
```html
<a href="enki.zip">
Download Zip
</a>
```
Result:

![link-download-zip](%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2254%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2254%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%230001EE%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2220%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EDownload%20Zip%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Cpath%20stroke%3D%22%230001EE%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20d%3D%22M20.5%2034.5h97%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

When web files and images are meant to be downloaded by the user, then the download attribute can be used to force that content to download just like a non-web file or image.   

Example of a web download link:
```html
<a
  href="summary.html"
  download="Today's%20Summary">
Download Web File
</a>
```
Result:

![link-download-web](%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2254%22%3E%3Cg%20fill%3D%22none%22%20fill-rule%3D%22evenodd%22%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%22320%22%20height%3D%2254%22%20fill%3D%22%23FFF%22%20rx%3D%229%22%2F%3E%3Ctext%20fill%3D%22%230001EE%22%20font-family%3D%22ArialMT%2C%20Arial%22%20font-size%3D%2216%22%3E%3Ctspan%20x%3D%2220%22%20y%3D%2233%22%3EDownload%20Web%20File%3C%2Ftspan%3E%3C%2Ftext%3E%3Cpath%20stroke%3D%22%230001EE%22%20stroke-linecap%3D%22square%22%20d%3D%22M20.5%2034.5h137%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E)

When the download attribute has a value, it will rename the downloaded file. This can be useful when your file is named `123z12zv824.docx` on your server, but you want it downloaded with something more friendly like `Enki%20Notes.docx`. Keep in mind that `%20` needs to replace any spaces in the filename.

When the value within the download attribute is empty (like `download="">`, then the downloaded file will retain its original filename. Of course, since the file will be a local file for the user, they can always rename that file as they wish, too.
