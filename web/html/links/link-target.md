# Target Link


---

## Content

Typically, a link will open another page within it's own window. This is because the default value for the target (or where the content should open) has the value of `_self`.

Typical link:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/">
  Links opens within existing window.
</a>
```

Link with default value displayed:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/"
  target="_self">
  Links opens within existing window.
</a>
```
The other values for the target are `target="value"`:

- _self     = (Default) Opens the link in the same tab
- _blank    = Opens the link in a new tab
- _top      = Opens the link in the full body of the window
- _parent   = Opens the link in the parent frame
- framename = Opens the link in a named frame

Example of opening the link in a different tab:

```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/"
  target="_blank">
  Links opens within new tab.
</a>
```
> ðŸ’¡ `_self` is only needed to open within the same tab/window when overriding conflicting code.

## Quiz

### How much do you know about the HTML


`target=""`

 attribute?

Why is it rare to use this code:
`<a href="http://enki.com" target="_self">`

???

- `_self` is only needed to open within the same tab when overriding conflicting code.
- It isn't common to allow users to download your entire webpage.
- The `target="self"` is typically used to download files like PDFs.
- Everyone already knows about Enki!
