# Target Link
---
## Content

Typically, a link will open another page within it's own window. This is because the default value for the target (or where the content should open) has the value of `_self`.

Typical link:
```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/">
  Links opens within existing window.
</a>
```

Link with default value displayed:
```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/"
  target="_self">
  Links opens within existing window.
</a>
```

The other values for the target are `target="value"`:

 - _self     = (Default) Opens the link in the same tab
 - _blank    = Opens the link in a new tab
 - _top      = Opens the link in the full body of the window
 - _parent   = Opens the link in the parent frame
 - framename = Opens the link in a named frame

Example of opening the link in a different tab:
```html
<a
  href="https://www.enki.com/"
  target="_blank">
  Links opens within new tab.
</a>
```

** Note:** `_self` is only needed to open within the same tab/window when overriding conflicting code.

## Practice

Create a link that will open the linked page within a new tab or browser window.

```html
<??? ???="http://enki.com"
  ???="???">
<???>
````

Which of these is not a valid target value?

```html
<a href="http://enki.com"
   target="???">
</a>
```

* `a`
* `href`
* `target`
* `_blank`
* `/a`
* `_new`
* `_parent`
* `_self`
* `_top`

## Revision

Which line of code opens the linked page in the existing browser window?

???

* `<a href="http://enki.com">`
* `<a href="http://enki.com" target="_blank">`
* `<a href="http://enki.com" target="_same">`
* `<a href="http://enki.com" target="tab">`

## Quiz

### How much do you know about the HTML `target=""` attribute?

Why is it rare to use this code:
`<a href="http://enki.com" target="_self">`

???

* `_self` is only needed to open within the same tab when overriding conflicting code.
* It isn't common to allow users to download your entire webpage.
* The `target="self"` is typically used to download files like PDFs.
* Everyone already knows about Enki!

## Game

Play the game determining if the target values for links are valid or fake.

`<a href="http://enki.com" target="___">`

Valid Target Values:Fake Target Values

```false

_new
%exp
This is a fake target value.
%

_other
%exp
This is a fake target value.
%

_son
%exp
This is a fake target value.
%

_empty
%exp
This is a fake target value.
%
```

```true

_blank
%exp
_blank is valid and opens the linked file in a new window/tab.
%

_parent
%exp
_parent is valid and opens the linked file in the parent frame.
%

_self
%exp
_self is valid and opens the linked file in the same frame as it was clicked and is the default value.
%

_top
%exp
_top is valid and opens the linked file in the full body of the window.
%

framename
%exp
framename represents the name of a frame in the page, so it can be valid and opens the linked file within the named frame.
%

```
