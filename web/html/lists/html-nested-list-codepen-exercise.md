## Exercise

In this exercise, you have have to create a nested ordered and unorderd list of instructions.

The ordered list should count in lowercase roman numerals from high-to-low and the first element of that list is the unordered sublist.

Both lists have 3 items.

Example of the finished exercise is on codepen.
