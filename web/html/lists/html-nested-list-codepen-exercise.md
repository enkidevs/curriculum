# HTML nested list

## Content

In this exercise, you will create a **nested list**:  

1. An **ordered list** (`<ol>`) that uses lowercase roman numerals (`i, ii, iii`).  
2. The list should count **from high-to-low** and have 3 items.  
3. The **first item** of this ordered list should contain an **unordered sublist** (`<ul>`) with 3 items.  

In the end it should look like this:

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `<ol>` tag for ordered lists and `<ul>` for unordered lists.  
- To set the list style to lowercase roman numerals, use the `type` attribute:  
```html
  <ol type="i" reversed>
    ...
  </ol>
```
- The reversed attribute will make the ordered list count from high-to-low.
