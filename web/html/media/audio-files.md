# Audio Files

## Content

In order to support all browsers, it is useful to provide two different types of audio within your `<audio>` players: mp3/m4a & ogg

![audio-formats-browser](https://img.enkipro.com/3e463b8c6eca4d637159f063d1837816.png)

**MP3**: The most popular audio format for its small compressed size and great audio.

**M4A**: The newest audio format works with all same browsers as MP3, but should be used moving forward.

**OGG**: Less popular than MP3/M4A, but its open source and widely available and actually has greater compression due to its variable bit rate with the same great audio.

Using the `<audio>` tag, multiple
songs can be added via the `<source>` element which will accomodate the approprate file needed for that browser.

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="some_song.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="some_song.ogg"
    type="audio/ogg">
     You're seeing this because
     your browser does not support
     the <audio> element.
</audio>
```
