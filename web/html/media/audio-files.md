# Audio Files


---

## Content

Previously, in order to support all browsers, it was useful to provide two different types of audio within your `<audio>` players: mp3/m4a & ogg.

However, that is no longer the case.

![all-audio-format-browsers](https://img.enkipro.com/f969fae6edd7f2063a66bf7cec803c63.png)

All browsers, except Internet Explorer, support these formats:

- WAV
- MP3
- M4A
- MP4
- OGG
- ADTS
- FLAC

Internet Explorer only supports MP3 and MP4 as of **IE9**.

These three are the most used formats:

**MP3**: The most popular audio format for its small compressed size and great audio.

**M4A**: The newest audio format works with all same browsers as MP3, but should be used moving forward.

**OGG**: Less popular than MP3/M4A, but its open-source and widely available and actually has greater compression due to its variable bit rate with the same great audio.

Using the `<audio>` tag, multiple songs can be added via the `<source>` element which will accommodate the appropriate file needed for that browser.

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="some_song.mp3"
    type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="some_song.ogg"
    type="audio/ogg">
     You're seeing this because
     your browser does not support
     the <audio> element.
</audio>
```
