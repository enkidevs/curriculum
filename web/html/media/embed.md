# The `<embed>` Element

---
## Content

In HTML you can use the `<embed>` element to embed an external application or a plug-in(like Adobe Flash Player) to your web page or document.

Example:
```html
<embed type="video/quicktime"
    src="dancing_stick-man.mov"
      width="360" height="360">
```

In the example above we have embedded a dancing stick-man video to our page within a 360-pixel with 360-pixel frame.

The `<embed>` element was introduced in HTML5. It has to have a starting tag and can't have a closing tag.

**Important:**
  - **Not all mobile devices support plug-ins.**
  - **Many modern browsers have deprecated and removed the support for plug-ins, so using the `<embed>` element is no longer recommended.**
  - **For implementing audio you should use the `<audio>` element, and for implementing video you should use the `<video>` element.**
