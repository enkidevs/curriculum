2. Add the provided audio file URL as the `src`.  
3. Include a fallback `<p>` element with the message:  
   > "You're seeing this because your browser does not support the audio element."  

In the end it should look like this:

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `controls` attribute on the `<audio>` tag to display built-in playback controls.  
- Example:  
```html
  <audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <p>You're seeing this because your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
  </audio>
```
