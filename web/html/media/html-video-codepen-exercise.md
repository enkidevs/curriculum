## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `controls` attribute on the `<video>` tag to display built-in playback controls.  
- Example:  
```html
  <video controls width="250" height="250">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p>You're seeing this because your browser does not support the video element.</p>
  </video>
```
