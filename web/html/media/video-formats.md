# Video Formats


---

## Content

Due to all the various ways users can view web content  today (computers, phones, game systems, etc), there are various video file formats required by each of them to view the videos properly. It is considered a best practice to provide your video in all of these formats, so when a browser can't load the first file, it will try the second one, and later the third, eventually finding one that will work.

As you can see, you really only need 2 HTML5 video formats for modern web browsers. Since Google created WebM, it has become more common to provide only WebM & MP4 for modern HTML5 browsers.

This CodePen will provide all the necessary code - it's a decent chunk compared to just the `video` element.

**Note:**

- If your video plays OK on your local computer, but doesn't play on the web server you should add the video types needed on the .htaccess file in your directory where the video is.

Create a file in your main web folder with the filename `.htaccess`. Then, add this text to the document:

```plain-text
AddType video/ogg .ogv
AddType video/mp4 .mp4
AddType video/webm .webm
```
