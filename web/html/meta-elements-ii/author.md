# The `author` Attribute
---
## Content

The HTML meta `author` attribute is used to provide information about who the author of the web page is.

```html
<meta
  name="author"
  content="John Doe">
```

The author metadata has no effect on search engine optimization or SEO.

Some content management systems (CMS) have an easier time tracking signed-in editors and will add the name of who last made changes to the page in order to make it easier to track who is responsible for the content on that page.
