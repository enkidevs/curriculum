# The `robot` Attribute
---
## Content

The HTML meta `robot` attribute is used to define the behavior that robots, or cooperative crawlers, should follow on a page.

Example:
```html
<meta
  name="robots"
  content="noindex, nofollow'>
```

In the example above, with the `noindex` parameter we have told the search engine not to index the page, and with the `nofollow` parameter we have told crawlers not to follow any links on a page.

If no robot tag is present, the default value is `content="index, follow">`. Which tells the robot to index the page and crawl through the rest of the pages.

There are a couple of more parameters you can set. These are:
 - `noimageindex`
 - `none`
 - `noarchive`
 - `nocache`
 - `nosnippet`
 - `nodp`

The `index`, `noindex`, `follow` and `nofollow` values are used by all browsers.

The `noimageindex` value is used to instruct the crawler not to index any images on a page. Used by Google.

The `none` value is equivalent to using the `noindex` and `nofollow` tags simultaneously. Used by Google.

The `noarchive` value is used to tell search engines not to cache the content of the page. Used by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.

The `nocache` value is the same as the `noarchive` value. Used only by Bing.

The `nosnippet` value is used to prevent search engines from displaying any page description in the search engines result. Used by Google and Bing.

The `nodp` value is used to prevent the use of the `Open Directory Project` description as the description of the page in the search engine result. Used by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.
