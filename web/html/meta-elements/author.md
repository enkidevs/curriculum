## Content

In HTML the `<meta>` tag is used to describe metadata within a document.
For instance, if you want to add information about who the author of the web page is, you would write:

```bash
<meta
  name="author"
  content="John Doe">
```

The author metadata has no effect on search engine optimization or SEO.
