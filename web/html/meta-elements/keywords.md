# Keywords
---
## Content

The HTML `keyword` meta tag contains important words that are relevant to the content of the page. Before a few years ago it was used for search engines and ranking. If you would google something, Google will display results based on your words.

Website owners could see how many people got to their website based on those keywords. They could also see which page on their web page they landed or how much time they spent and etc.

Nevertheless, today `keywords` are no longer useful for SEO(Search Engine Optimization). Search engines will no longer tell the website owner thanks to which keywords users got to their website, nor will they display websites based on those keywords. Today, for instance, Google, displays what they think was your intention behind that search. If you type travel directions from A to B, nowadays google will give you a map and the fastest root to your destination. Whereas before, it would give you websites that have those keywords in them, and you would have to navigate to a website to check your answer, or go to any mapping website and type your destination A and destination B.

How you write keyword meta tag:
```
 <meta
  name="keywords"
  content="HTML,XHTML">
```
