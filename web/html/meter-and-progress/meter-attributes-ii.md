# More `<meter>` Attributes


---

## Content

We've previously discussed the `value`, `low` and `high` attributes for the `<meter>` element. Let's now take a look at the rest.

- The `min` attribute is used to set the lower bound of the range. If specified, the value of the `min` attribute has to be lower than the value of the `max` attribute. On the other hand, if the `min` attribute is not specified, the minimum value is set to `0`.

- The `max` attribute is used to set the upper bound of the range. If specified, the value of the `max` attribute has to be greater than the value of the `min` attribute. On the other hand, if the `max` attribute is not specified, the maximum value is set to `1`.

- The `optimum` attribute is used to specify the optimum value. This value has to be between the `min` and `max` attribute values. If the `optimum` value is used together with the `low` and `high` attribute, then the value of the `optimum` attribute is considered the most preferable value for that range. Also, if the value of the `optimum` attribute is between `min` and `low`, then the `min`, or the lower attribute, is the preferred value. On the other hand, if the value of the `optimum` attribute is between `high` and `max`, then the `max`, or the higher attribute, is the preferred value.

- The `form` attribute is used to associate the `<meter>` element with the `<form>` element which has ownership over it. This is only necessary if the `<meter>` element is not a direct descendant of the `<form>` element who's using it.

**Note: Each attribute value(from the 7 attributes previously mentioned) has to be a valid floating point number.**
