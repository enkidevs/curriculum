- The `value` attribute is the current value. The value of the `value` attribute has to be between the `min` and `max` attribute values(if they are present), or if they are not present, between `0` and `1`. Also, if the `value` attribute is not specified the value of the `value` attribute is set to equal 0. On the other hand, it the `value` attribute is specified, however, it is not within the given `min` and `max` range, the value is set to equal the nearest end of the range.

- The `low` attribute is used to specify a range which is considered as a `low` value. If specified, the value of the `low` attribute has to be greater than the `min` value, and it has to be lower than the `high` and `max` attribute values, respectively. On the other hand, if the `low` value is not specified, or is lower than the `min` value, it is set to equal the `min` value.

- The `high` attribute is used to specify a range which is considered as a `high` value. If specified, the value of the `high` attribute has to be lower than the `max` value, and it also has to be greater than the `low` and `min` attribute values, respectively. On the other hand, if the `high` value is not specified, or is greater than the `max` value, it is set to equal the `max` value.
