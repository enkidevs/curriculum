# Footer
---
## Content

The HTML `<footer>` element is used to represent a footer for a whole document, or even footers of a grouping of related content as it is possible to have multiple `<footer>` elements. 

The `<footer>` element should contain some information about its containing element. That can be the author, some copyright information, a link to the terms of use, contact info, link back to the top of the page, a link to related documents, a sitemap, etc.

Using `<footer>` for contact information:
```html
<footer>
  <p>
    Author: Jane Doe
  </p>
  <p>
  Contact:
    <a
      href="mailto:janedoe@example.com">
      janedoe@example.com
    </a>.
  </p>
</footer>
```

The `<footer>` container doesn't have any visual style without CSS. The CSS in this example may be a bit complex at this time, but hopefully it inspires you to learn more CSS!
