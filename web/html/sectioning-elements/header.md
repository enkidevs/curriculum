# The `<header>` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<header>` element is used to represent some introductory content.

This can be an introduction, some navigational aid, a graphical logo, the authors' name, a search form, display one or more heading (h1-h6) elements, and more.

You can also have multiple `<header>` elements on your web page, one for the primary layout and for each grouping of related content.

This example showcases two headers within a web page:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Logo</h1>
</header>

<article>
  <header>
    <h1>
      First order 50% off!!
    </h1>
    <h2>Order pizza now</h2>
    <p>
    Order two pizza's get 2L Pepsi free!
    </p>
  </header>
  <p>
    We also have:
    We also have: Chicken, Pineapple,
    Ghost Peppers and more..
  </p>
</article>
```

The `<header>` container doesn't have any visual style without CSS. The CSS in this example may be a bit complex at this time, but hopefully it inspires you to learn more CSS!

Even though you can have multiple `<header>` elements, you can't nest  `<header>` elements within another `<header>` element. Also, the `<header>` element can't be within a `<footer>` or an `<address>` element.
