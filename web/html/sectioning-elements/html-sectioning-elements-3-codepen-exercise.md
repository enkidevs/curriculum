# HTML semantics 3

---

## Content

In this exercise, you will **wrap the main content of the page** in the appropriate semantic element.  

Use the `<main>` element to identify the dominant content of the page.  

In the end it should look like this:  

![html-semantics-3-finished](https://img.enkipro.com/865264f88c9f9471b7eb82f49c871de8.png)

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Use the `<main>` element to wrap the primary content of the page.  
- Do **not** include headers, footers, or navigation bars inside `<main>`.  
```html
<main>
  <!-- main page content -->
</main>
```
