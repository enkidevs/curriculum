# Main element

## Content

The HTML `<main>` element is used to specify the main content of a web page, document or an application and there should **only be one per web page**.

It usually consists of content that is directly related to the central topic, or the central functionality of an application.

Also, the `<main>` element should not contain content that is repeated throughout the whole website, or across multiple documents, such as:
 - copyright information
 - navigational links
 - search forms
 - sidebars
 - site logo

Example of the main content of a page, in this case, a page describing vehicles:
```html
<header>
  <img src="logo.svg" alt="Company Logo">
</header>
<main>
  <h1>Vehicles</h1>
  <p>
    Vehicles are ways of transports
    humans made of ease of transport.
  </p>

 <article>
    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <p>
      This is a ground vehicle
      which has 4 tires,
      is very stable and is
      perfect for driving
      small groups
      like family or friends,
      between 4-6 people.
    </p>
    <p>... </p>
 </article>

 <article>
    <h2>Bus</h2>
    <p>
      This is also a ground vehicle
      which has 8-12 tires,
      is also very stable,
      and is used to transport
      large groups of people
      at once(80 max).
    </p>
    <p>... </p>
  </article>

 <article>
    <h2>Aeroplane</h2>
    <p>
      This is a flying vehicle,
      which is used to transport
      large amounts of people
      (up to 200 people),
      usualy to places that
      ground vehicles can't
      get too easily, or
      can't get fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>... </p>
 </article>
</main>
<footer>
    <p>Â© Copyright</p>
</footer>
```

The `<main>` container doesn't have any visual style without CSS. The CSS in this example may be a bit complex at this time, but hopefully it inspires you to learn more CSS!

As you can see in the example above, we have added `<article>` within our `<main>` element to clearly separate each type of vehicle. The `main` is also between the `header` and `footer`.
