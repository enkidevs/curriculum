# Nav element

---
## Content

The HTML `<nav>` element is used to group the navigation of the page, such as primary website navigational links, table of contents, previous/next buttons, or breadcrumbs.

Example:
```html
<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

The `<nav>` container doesn't have any visual style without CSS. The CSS in this example may be a bit complex at this time, but hopefully it inspires you to learn more CSS!

**Note:** Not all links should be inside a `<nav>` element. The `<nav>` element is intended for major blocks of navigational links. For instance, links within the content of articles don't need to be wrapped within the `<nav>` element.

Multiple `<nav>` elements can be placed within the web page or document, when appropriate.

The `<nav>` element is also important for screen readers of visually disabled users. They use this element to determine whether the initial rendering of navigation-only content should be omitted.
