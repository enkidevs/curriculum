# Nav element

---
## Content

The HTML `<nav>` element is used to represent a section of the page. The purpose of this section is to provide navigational links, table of contents, previous/next buttons or breadcrumbs.

Example:
```
<nav>
  <a href="/page1/">Page1</a> |
  <a href="/page2/">Page2</a> |
  <a href="/page3/">Page3</a> |
 Â <a href="/page4/">Page4</a> |
  <a href="/page10/">Page10</a>
</nav>
```

**Note: Not all links should be inside a `<nav>` element. The `<nav>` element is indented for major blocks of navigational links. For instance, the footer element can contain links that don't go in the `<nav>` element.**

You can also have multiple `<nav>` elements in your web page or document. One for the website navigation and one for page navigation.

The `<nav>` element is also used with screen readers who target disabled users. They use this element to determine whether the initial rendering of navigation only content should be omitted.
