# The `<article>` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<article>` element is used to represent independent, self-contained content in a document, page, website or an application. This content is independently reusable and shared outside or within a web page.

The `<article>` element can contain:
  - a forum post
  - a magazine
  - a newspaper article
  - blog entry

Example:
```html
<article>
  <h1>Facebook</h1>
  <p>
    Connect with friends,
    family and other people you know.
    Share photos and videos,
    send messages and get updates.
  </p>
</article>
```

Additionally, each `<article>` element should be properly identified by adding a heading element(`<h1>`-`<h6>`) as it's child.

You can also nest `<article>` elements. When nested within another `<article>` element, the inner `<article>` element represents an article related to the outer element. For instance, comments on a social media post can be `<article>` elements nested within the `<article>` element representing that social media post.
