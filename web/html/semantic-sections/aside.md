# The `<aside>` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<aside>` element is a container element used to represent a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the `<aside>` element. This content is held separate from the page content and frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

The `<aside>` element can contain a sidebar, pull quotes, advertising, groups of navigational `<nav>` elements and more.

Example:
```html
<p>
  My family and I visited
  the Louvre this summer.
</p>
<aside>
  <h4>Louvre Museum</h4>
  <p>
    The Louvre Museum is the world's
    largest art museum in Paris, France.
  </p>
</aside>
```
