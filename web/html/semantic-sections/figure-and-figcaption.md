# Figure & Figcaption
---
## Content

The HTML `<figure>` element is used to represent self-contained content. Also, the `<figure>` element frequently has a `<figcaption>` element within it which is used to display a caption of the content and must be either the first or last child of the `<figure>` element.

The `<figure>` element is usually an image, code snippet, diagram, illustration, etc., which is referenced in the main flow of the document. Also, the `<figure>` elements content can also be moved to another part of the document without having any effect on the main flow.

Example with a poem:
```html
<figure>
 <p>
   Old cave, hidden door,<br>
   Carved ceiling, ancient floor,<br>
   Statue of old, a hero bold,<br>
   Sitting on his throne of gold,<br>
   King of legend, time forgot,<br>
   Now all that is left is for him to rot.
 </p>
 <figcaption><cite>Old Cave</cite>.
  Author: Unknown</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Practice

Match the code with the tags to properly define a caption for the photo.

```html
<tag1>
  <img src="waterfall.jpg"
  alt="Seljalandsfoss waterfall
       in Iceland">
  <tag2>
    The Seljalandsfoss waterfall
    in Iceland.

            /photos/enki/">
       Enki Pro
    </a>
  </tag2>
</tag1>
```
