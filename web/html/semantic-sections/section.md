# The `<section>` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<section>` element is used to represent a standalone section. Usually, This is a section which doesn't have a better element to represent it within that HTML document.

**Note:** Each `<section>` element should be properly identified, usually with a heading `<h1>`-`<h6>`.

Example:
```html
<section>
  <h1>Page name</h1>
  <p>Related info to page</p>
</section>
```

If an `<article>`, `<aside>`, or `<nav>` element is more appropriate in your HTML document, don't use the `<section>` element. If you need a container for styling and/or scripting don't use the `<section>` element, use `<div>` instead.

It is encouraged to use the `<article>` element instead of the `<section>` element when it would make more sense to syndicate the contents of the element.
