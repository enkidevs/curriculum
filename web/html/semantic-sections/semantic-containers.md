# Semantic Containers
---
## Content

When describing semantic elements or containers, in HTML, the term `semantic` refers to when both the developer and the browser clearly understand the meaning of the element.


Some new semantic elements introduced in HTML5:
 - `<article>`
 - `<aside>`
 - `<details>`
 - `<footer>`
 - `<header>`
 - `<main>`
 - `<nav>`
 - `<section>`
 - `<summary>`
 - `<time>`


Short explanation of each element:

 - `<article>` = self-contained content that is distributable and reusable.
 - `<aside>`= content only slightly related to the main content.
 - `<details>` = widget that appears only when toggled with a `<summary>` or `<label>`
 - `<footer>` = represents a root element
 - `<header>` = represents introductory content
 - `<main>` = represents dominant or main content
 - `<nav>` = represents a section of the page for navigational links
 - `<section>` = represents a standalone section
 - `<summary>` = specifies a summary or caption for a `<details>` element
 - `<time>` = represents a specific period in time


For some of the elements above, the equivalent way of writting in HTML4 was:
 - `<div class="article">`
 - `<div class="aside">`
 - `<div class="footer">`
 - `<div class="header">`
 - `<div class="main">`
 - `<div class="nav">`
 - `<div class="section">`

The `<div>` and `<span>` elements are HTML containers, however, they are not semantic elements.

Also, there are elements which are containers, however, they are not semantic elements.

These are:
 - `<div>` defines a division or section
 - `<span>` used to group inline elements
