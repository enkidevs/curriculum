# Semantic Containers
---
## Content

Semantic elements are elements that clearly define their content both for the browser and developer.

Some new semantic elements introduced in HTML5:
 - `<header>`
 - `<nav>`
 - `<main>`
 - `<footer>`
 - `<article>`
 - `<aside>`
 - `<details>`
 - `<section>`
 - `<summary>`
 - `<time>`

Short explanation of each element:

 - `<header>` = represents introductory content.
 - `<nav>` = represents a section of the page for navigational links.
 - `<main>` = represents dominant or main content
 - `<footer>` = represents a root element
 - `<article>` = self-contained content that is distributable and reusable.
 - `<aside>`= content only slightly related to the main content.
 - `<details>` = widget that appears only when toggled with a `<summary>` or `<label>`
 - `<section>` = represents a standalone section
 - `<summary>` = specifies a summary or caption for a `<details>` element
 - `<time>` = represents a specific period in time

For some of the elements above, the equivalent way of coding these container in HTML4 was:

 - `<div class="header">`
 - `<div class="main">`
 - `<div class="nav">`
 - `<div class="section">`
 - `<div class="footer">`

The problem with the HTML4 technique was that the class names could be named anything by the developer, thus there was no way from the class names search engine or for the developers to know what content was in the containers. 

The `<div>` and `<span>` elements are HTML containers, however, they are not semantic elements.
 - `<div>` defines a division or section
 - `<span>` used to group inline elements
