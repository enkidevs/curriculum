# The `<colgroup>` & `<col>` Elements
---
## Content

Tables within HTML use the `<colgroup>` & `<col>` elements to help define groups of columns. The `<colgroup>` element is useful for applying styles to entire columns, rather than repeating styles for each cell in every row.

However this is rarely useful because if you set the background of a row element or table cell element, that will always beat a background of a `<col>` element - regardless of specificity.

The `<col>` element has one element-specific attribute: `span`, and is used to specify how many columns the `<col>` element extends. If the attribute is not provided, the default value is `1`.

You can edit the `<col>` element by using the appropriate CSS properties, for instance:
  - `width`
  - `text-align`


Example with both elements:
```html
<table>
 <colgroup>
  <col span="2"
    style="background-color:lightblue">
  <col
    style="background-color:hotpink">
  <col span="3"
    style="background-color:mediumpurple">
 </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td>col 1</td>
    <td>col 2</td>
    <td>col 3</td>
    <td>col 4</td>
    <td>col 5</td>
    <td>col 6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

In the example above, the `<colgroup>` element is used to create a group of 3 `<col>` elements and the `<tr>` element is used to create a single row with 6 `<td>` elements. Each col element spans differently and has a different style; first `<col>` spans 2 columns and is `lightblue`, 2nd `<col>` spans 1 column and is `hotpink` and the third and last `<col>` spans 3 columns and is `mediumpurple`.

## Practice

Write the code to create the following table:

```html
<table>
 <tag1>
  <tag2 span="2"
   style="background-color:lightblue">
  <tag2
   style="background-color:hotpink">
  <tag2 span="3"
   style="background-color:mediumpurple">
  </tag1>
  <tr>
   <td>col 1</td>
   <td>col 2</td>
   <td>col 3</td>
   <td>col 4</td>
   <td>col 5</td>
   <td>col 6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

tag1 = ???
