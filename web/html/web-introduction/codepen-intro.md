# Web Playground

---

## Content

We will be using this playground to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

Go ahead and take a look at the **Code** tab.  

You have 3 files that you can switch between on the bottom:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

Hit **Run** right now to see how it works!  

If youâ€™re unsure how to begin, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]
- Check the `index.html` file for the structure of your page.  
- See how `style.css` changes its appearance.  
- Open the console (Ctrl+Shift+J / Cmd+Option+J) to view messages from `script.js`.
