# CSS Defined

## Content

`CSS` or **Cascading Style Sheets** is a `stylesheet` language used to describe the presentation of an HTML, XML, or XHTML document. It is used to provide styling for text, images, & links.

Basically, CSS is used for creating responsive layouts, animations, styling text, and positioning containers. By applying CSS, you add a nice and more beautiful look and feel to your websites.

On the other hand, CSS is not good for inserting media, creating links, doesn't allow math expressions and database storage.
