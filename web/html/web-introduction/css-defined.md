# CSS Defined

## Content

`CSS` or **Cascading Style Sheets** is a `stylesheet` language used to describe the presentation of an HTML, XML, or XHTML document. It's used to provide styling for text, images, & links.

In short, CSS is used to create responsive layouts, animations, styling text, and positioning containers. By applying CSS, you add the look and feel that you'd like to your websites.

However, CSS is not good for inserting media, creating links, and it also doesn't allow math expressions and database storage.
