# HTML/CSS in the Browser
---
## Content

**HTML** and **CSS** are languages used by browsers to present information to the users.

An **HTML** web page will display text, images, links, and containers, but has little control over how that content appears.

A **CSS** document will provide the rules for how the text, images, links, and containers should appear - whether it's setting text to bold or italic, setting width, height, and position for an image or container. If a `.css` file is opened in a browser, the browser would just display the **CSS** code exactly as it is written in a code editor.

Let's say we have 2 files:
```
HTML file:
<p>
  This is a paragraph
</p>

CSS file:

p { color: green; }
```

Loading only the **HTML** file gives the paragraph mentioned above.

Loading both files gives the paragraph mentioned above and colors it green.

However, loading just the **CSS** file will only show the text `p { color: green; }`.

**Note:** XHTML or XML can be used instead of **HTML** to produce the same result. The only difference between them is the syntax; some have looser syntax while other have stricter.
