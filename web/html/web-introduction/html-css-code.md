# HTML/CSS Code
---
## Content

**CSS** and **HTML** are the core languages used for creating web pages and web-based applications.

**HTML** creates the structure and content of a webpage with text, images, links, and containers, while **CSS** modifies the design and display of those items in the HTML page.

**HTML** is made up of content between tags; `<tag>Content here</tag>`.

**CSS** is made of selectors followed by a declaration block; `selector {declaration block}`.

HTML example:
```html
<h2>
  This is a heading
</h2>
<p>
  This is a paragraph
</p>
```

CSS example:
```css
p { color: red; }
h2 { font-size: 24px; }
```

In the **HTML** example above, we create a heading and paragraph elements.  
In the **CSS** example above, we set the **HTML** `<p>` elements content to the color `red`, and the font size of the `<h2>` elements content to 24 pixels.
