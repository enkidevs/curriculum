# HTML/CSS Introduction


---

## Content

**CSS** and **HTML** are the core languages used for creating web pages and web-based applications. **HTML** was invented in 1989, while **CSS** was invented in 1996.

**HTML**, or **HyperText Markup Language** is a markup language for creating the structure and content of a webpage using text, images, links, and containers. Meanwhile **CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, is used to modify the design and display of those **HTML** elements.

**HTML** is made up of content between `<tags>`, whereas **CSS** is made of selectors followed by a {declaration block}.

When creating a website, all of your unique HTML and CSS files for the same website are usually located inside a folder like so:

```plain-text
/your-website-folder
  /html_files
    main.html
    contact.html
  /css_files
    main.css
    contact.css
```
