# Doctype

## Content

In HTML, every page, no matter the version of HTML it is written in, requires a doctype declaration telling the browser how to render the document properly.

Technically, the doctype declaration isn't an HTML element, but a specific direction for browsers to understand they type of web page being delivered.

The doctype declaration for HTML5 is:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Although the doctype declaration can be written both in lower and uppercase letters, it tends to be most widely accepted for `DOCTYPE` to be written in uppercase and `html` to be written in lowercase letters. 

This is only one doctype declaration for HTML5 compared to the three doctype declarations used for HTML 4.01 making this much similar for developers.
