# The `<html>` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<html>` element is the root (top-level element) of an HTML document and is the primary container for all of the other elements in the documents, which are the descendants of this one element.

Within every `<html>` element are two primary elements:
* `<head>`: Data useful for the page.
* `<body>`: The content of the page itself.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>
```

The `lang` attribute is useful for helping both search engines and screen readers determine the proper language of the text on the page. When the `lang` attribute is not included, screen readers will use the operating system's set language, which isn't always the best because it may not provide the proper accents and pronunciation.

The `<html>` element is easily modifiable with CSS by using either the `html` or the `:root` selector. The selectors are identical, except that the `:root` selector's specificity is higher (meaning it will override `html`).

For instance, by adding the CSS:
```css
:root {
    background: #ff0000;
}
html {
    background: #0000ff;
}

```

we change the background color of the `:root` to red, and even though the `html` has been set to blue, the `:root` style overrides it.
