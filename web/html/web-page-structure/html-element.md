# The `html` Element
---
## Content

The HTML `<html>`, or, **The HTML Document/Root Element** is used to represent the root of an HTML document.

The `<html>` element is called the `root` element because it has to be on the top of a document. Also, it is the single HTML element that contains every other HTML element. This means all other elements have to be descendants of the `<html>` element.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>
```

Adding the `lang` attribute with a valid language tag is very important for helping screen readers determine the proper language. Also, the `lang` attributes value should describe a language which is used in the majority of the content of the page. On the other hand, if you do not include the `lang` attribute, screen readers will use the operating system's set language, which is not good, because it can cause mispronunciations.

Furthermore, if you include a valid `lang` in the `<html>` element, you ensure all metadata will be announced properly.

Also, the `<html>` element is easily modifiable with CSS by using the `:root` selector.
For instance, by adding the CSS:
```
:root {
    background: #ff0000;
}
```
we change the background color of the whole html page into red.
