# Optional Elements


---

## Content

In HTML5, there are a lot of optional tags where either the starting, ending, or both tags can be omitted. Just because an element's tag is omitted, it doesn't mean the element itself is not present at all. It means that it is implied and is there no matter if the markup code doesn't contain the typical tags.

Some optional elements:

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`'s closing tag.

Although this isn't a very common practice, Google's HTML styleguide recommends that optional tags be used to help cut down on the file size and improve the scannability of the document. They also recommend that developers not pick some optional tags and omit others as consistency is important in avoiding simple mistakes.

```html
<!-- Not recommended by Google -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Spending money,
    spending bytes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Sic.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- Recommended by Google -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Saving money,
saving bytes</title>
<p>Qed.
```

> ‚ùó Not all tags can be omitted. For example, `<title>` will still need an opening and closing tag.

In order for the document to display properly with all the optional tags omitted, there are various conditions that need to be met. Check out the *Learn More* section for a full list of optional tags and conditions.
