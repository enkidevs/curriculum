# Using animation delay in debugging

---
## Content

Set `animation-play-state: paused;` and `animation-delay` to different negative times to help with animation debugging:

```css
.animated {
  animation: move 3s linear
             infinite
             alternate;
  /* for debugging only: */
  animation-play-state: paused;
  /* to show expected state at 2s: */
  animation-delay: -2s;  
}
```

The example above shows the animation paused at the 2 second point of the animation lifecycle.

---
## Practice

Pause the animation at second 4:
```css
.debugAnimation{
  animation: animate 6s
             linear infinite;
  ???: ???;
  ???: ???;
```

* `animation-play-state`
* `paused`
* `animation-delay`
* `-4`
* `4`
* `stop`
* `animation-time`
