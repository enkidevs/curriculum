# Borders


---

## Content

Borders occupy the space between margin and padding, providing an outline of the element.

`border` has three properties: `width`, `style`, and `color`. Each of them can be declared individually:

```css
div{
  border-width: 4px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red;
}
```

Or you can use the shorthand notation:

```css
div{
  border: red 4px solid;
}
```

You can declare it with **any combination** of `width`, `style`, and `color` in **any order**.

> ⚠️ You need to set the `style` for the border to show. If you don't, the default value is `none`. 

Borders can have different styles such as `solid` (**the most common**), `dashed`, `dotted`, `double`, and others.

You can also set borders for sides individually:

```css
div{
  border-left: 4px dashed red;
  border-top: 2px double blue;
  border-right: 10px dotted green;
  border-bottom: 7px solid yellow;
}
```

## Practice

In this shorthand declaration code:

```css
border: dotted teal 12px;
```

The property that represents the style of the border is ???.

- dotted
- 12px
- teal

## Revision

Fill in the correct property names:
```css
div {
  border-???: dashed;
  border-???: 44px;
  border-???: green;
}
```
- style
- width
- color
