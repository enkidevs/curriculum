## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You can start by first creating the borders and matching the width, height, and color of the div element.

Next, match the margins and paddings on all four sides.

Lastly, align the text of the element to be centered.

Here are some guidelines to shorten your code:

```css
border-top: 2px dashed green;
border-bottom: 2px dashed green;
border-right: 2px dashed green;
border-left: 2px dashed green;
```

Is equivalent to this:
```css
border: 2px dashed green;
```

Also this:
```css
border-color: red red red red;
border-style: solid dashed dotted double;
border-width: 1px 2px 1px 2px;
```

Is equivalent to this:
```css
border-top:    1px solid  red;
border-right:  2px dashed red;
border-bottom: 1px dotted red;
border-left:   2px double red;
```
