# The *Box Model*

---
## Content

According to the **box model**, every element on the page is a rectangular box that may have `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding` or `border`.

The dimensions of such a box are calculated by summing the values of the above mentioned properties. To better understand the formula, consider this example:
```
div{
  width: 600px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 4px solid blue;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The total width of the whole element will be **20+4+10+600+10+4+20=668p**, which is the sum of the content width and left and right `margins`, `borders` and `paddings`.

It is important to mention that some elements *do not accept* top and bottom margin and padding. We will talk about these in more detail in a future workout.
