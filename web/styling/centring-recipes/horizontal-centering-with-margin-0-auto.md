# Horizontal centering with `margin: 0 auto;`

---
## Content

To horizontally center **block elements** of a known width:

```css
#horizontal-center {
  width: 960px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
The 2 value shorthand notation of `margin` targets `top/bottom-margins` and `left/right-margins`. Because the element is **block**, it occupies the whole width of the container.

The element also has a known width, so the browser can calculate the container's unused width. The `auto` value tells the browser to equally distantiate the block element from the left and the right margin, which effectively centers it horizontally.

## Revision

What does the following piece of CSS code do? ???

```css
#class {
   width: 960px;
   margin: 0 auto;
}
```


* Horizontally centres a block element with a known width.
* Gets rid of the margin.
* Vertically centres a block element with a known width.
* Horizontally centres a block element with an unknown width.
