# Determine the opacity of background-colors using the RGBA declaration

---
## Content

Setting a background color using *rgba color values*, allows you to change the transparency of the elements' background-color.  

This method is particularly useful as it sets the opacity for a single element and not its children. 


To do so use the rgba declaration:


```
background-color: rgba(15,255,30,0.5);
```

The rgba color values are specified in the following order: red, green, blue, and alpha. For full transparency use alpha-level 0.0, fully opaque is identified by level 1.0.

In the example above, the alpha level is 0.5, hence indicating 50% opacity.
