# Hexadecimal color system

---
## Content

Hexadecimal color system starts with `#` and is case-insensitive.

`#FFC125` displays the same color as `#ffc125`.


`#RRGGBB` is the standard format for hexadecimal.
`RR` relates to the degree of red.
`GG` relates to the degree of green.
`BB` relates to the degree of blue.

An important thing to be mentioned is that `#FFFFFF` is the same as `#FFF`.
