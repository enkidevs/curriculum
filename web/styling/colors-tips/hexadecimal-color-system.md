# Hexadecimal color system


---

## Content

The hexadecimal color system starts with `#` and is case-insensitive.

`#FFC125` displays the same color as `#ffc125`.

`#RRGGBB` is the standard format for hexadecimal.
`RR` relates to the degree of red.
`GG` relates to the degree of green.
`BB` relates to the degree of blue.

**Note:** `#FFFFFF` is the same as `#FFF`.

Hexadecimal runs from `0` to `F`
(`0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `9`, `A`, `B`, ..., `F`)
