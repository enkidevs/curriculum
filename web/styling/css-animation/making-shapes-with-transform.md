# Making shapes with `transform`

---
## Content

`Rotate` certain shapes using `transform` can be used to obtain other shapes.

Applying the `transform` property on a regular square can create a diamond, for example:
```css
#diamond {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```
The default rotation point is the center of the element. `transform-origin` can change that: it can take 2 (for 2D shapes) or 3 (for 3D shapes) values, as the `x` and `y` coordinates of the new rotation point.

The center of a 2D shape is:
```css
transform-origin: 50% 50%;
/* or */
transform-origin: center center;
/* for known dimensions: 500px Ã— 20em*/
transform-origin: 250px 10em;
```
Other values :
```css
transform-origin: top left;
transform-origin: right bottom;
transform-origin: left center;
```
This is the default rotation around its center:

## Revision

What are the missing values required to transform a diamond into a square?

```css
#transform {
   transform: ???(???);
}
```

* `rotate`
* `-45deg`
* `translate`
* `45%`
* `-45%`
