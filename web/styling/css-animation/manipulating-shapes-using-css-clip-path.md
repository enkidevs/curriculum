You can use functions that are applied to `shape-outside` to `clip-path`, ie, `inset()`, `polygon()`, `ellipse()`.
Below is an example of `clip-path` in action:

```css
#element {
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px;
  clip-path:
    polygon(0% 0%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%);
}
```
The list separated by commas define the *(x,y)* coordinates for each point. Translated into *px*, its equivalent would be `polygon(0px 0px, 300px 150px, 0px 150px)`. Three points will determine a triangle.

If you want text to wrap around a shape, you have to combine `clip-path` with the `shape-outside` property.

**Note:** Top-left corner of the `element` is located at *(0%,0%)*, while the bottom-right one at *(100%, 100%)*.

## Practice

Which two properties have to be combined in order for you to be able to wrap text around a shape?

???

*clip-path and shape-outside
*clip-path and inset
*inset and shape-outside
*path-wrap and shape-wrap

## Revision

What shape does the following piece of code make? ???

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #66ff33;
  clip-path: polygon
             (0% 100%, 100% 100%, 0% 0%);
}
```

* A triangle.
* A hexagon.
* A square.
* An octagon.
