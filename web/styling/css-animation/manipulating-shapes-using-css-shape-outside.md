# Manipulating shapes using CSS: `shape-outside`


---

## Content

You can wrap pieces of text around shapes using `shape-outside`. As of `CSS3`, this property only works on elements that have the property of `float` applied upon it.

Example:

```css
#element {
  float: left;
  shape-outside: circle(50%);
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

This is the visual equivalent of the above snippet:

![shapeoutsidecircle.svg](https://img.enkipro.com/bf10605b36534f1e04e0fd2e3d2972a7.png)

Other functions instead of `circle()` include: `ellipse()`, `polygon()`, `inset()`.

However, this property is not supported by IE and does not change the actual shape of the element.

## Practice

The `shape-outside` property only works on elements with the property of ??? applied onto it.

- float
- clear
- fixed
- shape
- alter

## Revision

For the `shape-outside` property to work, which property must have been applied to it? ???

- `float`
- `hover`
- `sticky`
- `absolute`
- `relative`
