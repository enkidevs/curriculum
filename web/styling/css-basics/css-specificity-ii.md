# CSS Specificity (Part 2)

---
## Content

Looking at the example from the previous insight, say we decide to give the heading the id of *title*:
```css
div div.my-class #title{}
```
And use two selectors to target the title of the page:
```css
div div.my-class #title{
  font-size: 30px;
}
div div.my-class h2{
  font-size: 40px;
}
```
If cascading alone was the way to go, the heading *font-size* would be 40. Taking specificity into account:
```plain-text
                        id - class - type
div div.my-class #title  1 -   1   -  2
div div.my-class h2      0 -   1   -  3
```
The font size is *30*.

As discussed earlier, inline CSS has the highest inherited specificity:
```html
<div>
  <div class="my-class">
    <h2 id="title"
      style="font-size:20px;">
      Title
    </h2>
  </div>
</div>
```
We would have to add a new column to the previous notation in order to represent inline CSS specificity:
```plain-text
internal - id - class - type
    1    - 0  -   0   -  0
```
This means that no matter how specific a selector might be, it can never outweigh the inline styling.

There are three other factors that influence the specificity of a selector. However, we won't go into details right now. All you have to know is:
 - attribute selectors increment the middle value: `a[href="www.example.com"]` (targets hyperlinks that have the href equals to *www.example.com*) has `0-1-1` specificity.
 - pseudo-classes increment the middle value as well: `li:nth-of-type(2n)` (targets list items with an even index) has `0-1-1` specificity.
 - the `!important` keyword added to the end of a CSS declaration:

```css
/* `1-0-1-0-0` specificity. */
#title{
  font-size: 60px !important;
}
```

## Practice

What is the specificity of the following CSS code snippet?
```css
p#myParagraph .class1 div.class2 {}
```

???

* 0-1-2-2
* 0-1-2-1
* 1-1-1-2
* 1-0-0-4

## Revision

What is the specificity of the following CSS code snippet?
```css
#div.selected a{}
```

???

* 0-1-1-1
* 0-0-2-1
* 1-1-2-1
* 0-2-1-0
* 1-1-1-0
* 1-2-1-2

## Quiz
### which of the following selectors has the highest specificity?

```css
#nav .selected > p:hover {} /* 1 */
#footer #note {} /* 2 */
div div ul li div div img {} /* 3 */
```

 ???

* 2
* 1
* 3
* both 1 and 2
