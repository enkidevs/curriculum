# CSS Specificity

---
## Content

Although a difficult topic, understanding how properties can be overridden will make you more confident when writing CSS code.

In the previous workout, we discussed three basic types of selectors:
 - type (`div`, `p`)
 - class (`.container`, `.title`)
 - id (`#contact`)

In order to better visualize which one has priority over the other, we can turn the list into a horizontal list:
```plain-text
id priority > class priority > type priority
```

The last step in calculating a selector's specificity is to see the above as the header of a table with three columns:
```plain-text
         id - class - type
selector  0 -   0   -  0
```
For each basic selector that is part of a more complex selector, we increment the value in the appropriate column.

For example, consider the following selector that aims to style a heading, nested inside a div of class *my-class*, which is another div's child:
```css
div div.my-class h2{}
```

There are three *type* selectors (*div, div and h2*) and one *class* selector (*.my-class*). We can use the previous syntax to represent the **specificity** of the selector:
```plain-text
id - class - type
0  -   1   -  3
```

However, this should not be seen as a base 10 representation. Adding an id selector on top of 99 class selectors would yield:
```plain-text
         id - class - type
selector  1 -   99   -  0
```

Moreover, when comparing two selectors, you should always be aware of one thing: it doesn't matter how many type or class basic selectors make up a more complex one, they will always be outweighed by a class or an id selector, respectively:
```plain-text
         id - class - type
selector1  0 - 110  -  0
selector2  1 -   0  -  0
```
In the above example, *selector2*'s styling is applied in case they target the same elements.

## Quiz
### which of the following selectors has the highest specificity?

```css
#nav .selected > p:hover {} /* 1 */
#footer #note {} /* 2 */
div div ul li div div img {} /* 3 */
```

 ???

* 2
* 1
* 3
* both 1 and 2
