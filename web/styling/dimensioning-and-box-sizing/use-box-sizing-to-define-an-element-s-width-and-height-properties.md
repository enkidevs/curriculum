# Use `box-sizing` to define an element's `width` and `height` properties

---
## Content

The default value for `box-sizing` is `content-box`. This setting indicates only the content is included in the total `width` and `height` properties.

Using `padding-box` will include the content and padding, but is only supported in Firefox.

The most popular value `border-box` will include content, padding and border. This makes working with percentages and building the layout easier, since the total `width` and `height` values include all three properties.

Both squares are initially defined as `250Ã—250`. Because of the different `box-sizing` values, one expands because of the padding, while the other does not:
