# The difference between display:none and visibility:hidden

---
## Content

`visibility:hidden` defines that an element is rendered on the page but not visible. Space on the page will be allocated for this element.

```css
#foo {
  visibility:hidden;
}
```

`display:none` defines that an element is not rendered on the page and thus does not appear. Unlike `visibility:hidden`, page space is not allocated for the element, allowing other elements to fill in.

```css
#foo {
  display:none;
}
```

Keep in mind that `display:none` will trigger a DOM reflow, while `visibility:hidden` will not.

A reflow is a recomputation of the page's layout, calculating positions and dimensions, being an expensive process.

???

* The element is not rendered on the page so consequently does not appear, page space is not allocated.
* The element is rendered on the page but does not appear, page space is allocated.
* The element is not rendered on the page so consequently does not appear, page space is allocated.
* The element is rendered on the page but does not appear, page space is not allocated.
