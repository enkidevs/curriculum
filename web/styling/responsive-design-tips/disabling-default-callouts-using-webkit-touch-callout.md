# Disabling default callouts using `webkit-touch-callout`

---
## Content

On iOS, when you touch and hold a touch target such as a link, the browser displays a callout containing information about the link.

You can use `-webkit-touch-callout` to disable the callout:

```css
-webkit-touch-callout: none;

```
*Note:* This is only compatible with Safari.
