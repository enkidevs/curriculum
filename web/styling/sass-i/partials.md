# Partials

---
## Content

*Sass* allows the creation of **partial** CSS/SCSS files that you can include in other Sass files through imports. This feature promotes modular code, thus keeping files easier to maintaining.

All you have to do to mark a file as *partial* is to include an underscore before its name: if the partial should style the header, a good name would be `_header.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is partial and a CSS file should not be generated for it. 

Partials are used with the `@import` directive, of which we will talk in the next insight.
