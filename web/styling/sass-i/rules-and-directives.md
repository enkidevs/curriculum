# @-Rules and Directives

---
## Content

On top of supporting all CSS3 @-rules, Sass has it's own specific @-rules, known as *`directives`*.

`@import` is extended by Sass to allow SCSS and Sass files to be imported. All imported files are merged together into one CSS file. 

`@import` takes a filename to import, it's default is to look for a *.sass* file to import.
```CSS
// both import the same file
@import "file.sass";       
@import "file";
```
`@debug` prints the value of a *SassScript* expression to the output stream. It's used for debugging Sass files which include complicated SassScript code.
```CSS
@debug 6px + 12px;
```
This would output:
```CSS
Line 1 DEBUG: 18px
```

---
## Practice

Complete the code snippet so that it returns the below output:

```css
??? 28px + ???px; 
/* Output */
Line 1 DEBUG: 42px 
```

* `@debug` 
* `14` 
* `@run` 
* `@compile` 
* `42` 
* `18`

## Revision

Which of the following lines of SassScript code *wouldn't* produce the following output?
``` css
Line 1 DEBUG: 80%
```
???

* `@debug percentage(200px / 120px);`
* `@debug abs(80);`
* `@debug round(80.42);`
