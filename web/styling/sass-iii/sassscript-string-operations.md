# SassScript String Operations

---
## Content

The `+` operation is used in *SassScript* for the concatenation of strings. 

Take note of the quotation marks in these examples:
```CSS
p {
  font-family: "sans-" + serif;
  font-family: Times + " New Roman";
}
```
Compiles to:
```CSS
p {
  font-family: "sans-serif";
  font-family: Times New Roman;
}
```
When concatenating, if the first string has quote marks, the concatenated string has quote marks surrounding it. If not, then the string does not have quote marks around it.

Within a text string, *`#{} style interpolation`* can be used to place dynamic values into a string:
```CSS
p:before {
  content: "Dynamic value insertion: 
            #{10 + 10}!";
}
```
Compiles to:
```CSS
p:before {
  content: "Dynamic value insertion: 20!";
 }
```

## Practice

Complete the code snippet to dynamically insert a value:

```css
p:before { 
  content: "Here we go: ???{1 + 13}"; 
} 
```


* `#` 
* `=` 
* `~` 
* `[]`

## Revision

What do the two following CSS lines of code compile to? Please answer in the order of the question. 
```css

```
??? ???

* `string: Hey everyone!;`
