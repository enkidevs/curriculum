# Removing the bullets from the `ul`

---
## Content

Once you have created your unordered list (`ul`) in HTML, simply add the `list-style-type` property and set it to *none* in your stylesheet.
```
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}
```

To remove any spacing, add `margin: 0;` and `padding: 0` to your ul-style.

## Practice

Which CSS property is used to determine the type of bullet points for an unordered list?

???


* `list-style-type` 
* `bullets-type` 
* `list-type` 
* `bullets-style`

## Revision

What does the following CSS code do? 
```css
ul {
   list-style-type: square;
}
```
???


* Tells the list to use squares instead of bullet points.
* Removes the bullet points from the unordered list.
* Sets the unordered list to format text into the shape of a square.
