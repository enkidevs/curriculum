# Make text unselectable


---

## Content

This is a method in CSS to make text in a web page unselectable.

```css
.noselect {
  user-select: none;
}
```

Once the class is assigned to a paragraph like below, the text will no longer be selectable.

```html
<p>
  Selectable text.
</p>
```

```html
<p class="noselect">
  Unselectable text.
</p>
```


---

## Practice

Complete the method which can be used to make text in a web page unselectable:

```plain-text
.unselectable {
  ???: none;
}
```

- `user-select`
- `selectable`
- `select`

## Revision

What does the following CSS code do?

```css
.noselect {
   user-select: none;
}

<p class="noselect">
   Hello, from Enki!
</p>
```

???

- It makes the contents of <p> unable to be selected.
- It makes the contents of <p> able to be selected.
- It changes the colour of <p>'s contents.
- It automatically highlights the contents of <p>.
