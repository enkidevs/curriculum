# Change the decoration color with `text-decoration-color`


---

## Content

The default for the color of the decoration lines is the same as the `color` of the text. But you can change that:

```css
a {
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-color: #c0ffee;
}
```

The only browser that currently supports this property is `Firefox`.

## Revision

What is the default text decoration colour? And with what property can this be changed? ???

- `Default colour is the text colour. Changed with text-decoration-color:`
- `Default colour is black. Changed with text-decoration-colour:`
- Default colour is white. Cannot be changed.
