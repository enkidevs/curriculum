# Inline vs Block Elements in HTML

---

## Content

In this exercise, you will:
- Use inline elements like `<span>` and `<strong>`.
- Use block-level elements like `<div>`.
- Understand how their layout differs by default.

If youâ€™re unsure how, check the hints[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

- Inline elements do not start on a new line.
- Block-level elements start on a new line and take full width.
- Example:

```html
<!--Span and strong are inline -->
<p>This is a <span>name</span> with a <strong>title</strong>.</p>

<div>This is block one.</div>
<div>This is block two.</div>
```
