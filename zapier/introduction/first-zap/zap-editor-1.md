## Content

Let's say that you want to receive a direct message on Slack every time a row in one of your spreadsheets is added or updated. Go to the [Explore page](https://zapier.com/apps/integrations/), select Google Sheets and Slack and choose `Post a new message to Slack whenever a Google Sheets row is updated`.

After clicking on the `Use this Zap` button[1], you will be presented with the following screen:

First, we need to set up Google Sheets. After signing in, you have to specify:
1. The spreadsheet
    - this is just the spreadsheet that contains your data
2. The worksheet
    - as with the spreadsheet, Zapier is interested in the worksheet that contains your data
3. The trigger column
    - lastly, Zapier wants to know which column to watch

Your screen should now look like this, and you are ready to press `Continue`.

Note: `Has Access?` is just the name of a **column** found in the `Access to your secret base` **worksheet**, which is found in the `Some Important Data` **spreadsheet**.

Zapier might ask you to test the connection, but for now you can press `Skip Test`[2].

## Footnotes

[1:Reminder]
Here is the card that you should choose:

[2:Connection Tests]
For this example we have chosen to skip the tests for simplicity. 

When testing a trigger in Zapier, a sample is searched for (e.g. a row in your spreadsheet), and with it you can:
- test & review
  - you will be able to preview sample data and decide which should Zapier use in the step
- test & continue
  - the connection will be tested, and if no errors show up, Zapier will finish setting up your step

Using these options you can ensure Zapier will be able to function correctly.
