## Content

Looking at the entire zap, we have created two steps:

Step by step, this zap will:
1. New or Update Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets
    - monitor a spreadsheet for any new or updated rows
2. Send Direct Message in Slack
    - send a direct message in slack that reads `Someone has gained access to your base!`

Your zap is now ready to be used. Go ahead and change a row in the spreadsheet and see how the magic happens.

Don't forget to turn on the zap in the top right corner of the screen.
