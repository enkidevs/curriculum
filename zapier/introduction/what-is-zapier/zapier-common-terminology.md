# Zapier Common Terminology

---
## Content

Now, let's introduce some of the terms that you'll see. Here is a list to help you get started[1].

### Zap
  - this refers to the automated workflow that connects apps and services
  - think of a zap as your entire integration
  - a zap is made out of tasks
  - e.g. we have previously mentioned that you can get email notification for each Google form completion. This is a zap.
### Trigger
  - this represents an event that starts a zap
  - in our example, the trigger would be the submittal of the Google form
### Action
  - this represents an event that will be performed by our zap after a trigger
  - going back to the example, the action is getting the email notification
### Task
  - this is more a general term that refers to any single piece of data that passes through a zap
  - in our example, submitting a form **or** receiving an email notification are both tasks
  - if your zap sends 5 emails, then it has performed 5 tasks
  - as you have already noticed, both triggers and actions can be tasks

Now, you are ready to create your first zap.

```

* The entire integration.
* An event that starts a zap.
* An event that will be performed be the zap after a trigger.
* Any single action performed by Zapier.
