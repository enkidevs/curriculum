## Content

Zapier provides built-in options for the most used integrations, common actions and for actions that can't be found in any other apps (e.g. delay).

Out of the most popular options, you can distinguish:
- Email
    - you can send emails without having an account for any provider
- SMS
    - you can send sms without having an account for any provider
- Delay
    - you can set timer for when your action should happen
- Formatter
    - transform the data you receive (e.g. take a string and convert it to lowercase)
- Schedule
    - same as delay, but the input is a specified interval (e.g. every week)


There are many other [built-in options](https://zapier.com/apps/categories/zapier-tools), and you can usually find them by searching for `Zapier`.
