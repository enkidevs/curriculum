# Email & SMS


---

## Content

With the Email built-in app, Zapier allows you to:

- **trigger** an action whenever you receive an email
  - the email is received on your own `@zapiermail.com` address
- as **an action**, send an email
  - the email is sent from the same `@zapiermail.com` address
  - there is a limit of 10 emails per hour

The SMS built-in app is a bit limited, with only one possible action:

- send a SMS
  - sends a SMS to a phone number
  - a successful action means that the SMS is queued, but not sent

Using these two built-in apps, you can set up triggers such that whenever your data changes you are alerted, no matter where you are.
