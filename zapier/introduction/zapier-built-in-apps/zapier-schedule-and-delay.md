# Schedule & Delay


---

## Content

The `Schedule` built-in app lets you trigger workflows at specific intervals. The trigger options you can pick from are: 

- every day
- every week
- every month
- every hour

The `Delay` built-in app helps you *pause* workflows based on time values. By adding a delay **action** within your workflow you'll be able to:

- delay for
  - when encountered in the flow, the zap will wait for the specified amount of time
- delay until
  - the zap will wait until a set date or time
- delay after queue
  - this option delays an action depending on the last queued delay
