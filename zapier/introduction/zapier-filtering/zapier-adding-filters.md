# Adding Filters

---
## Content

In this insight, we'll take a close look at how we can add filters using more than one check.

In the previous lessons, we used as an example a filter step which ensures that we react only to spreadsheet row changes where their `Has Access?` column is `Yes`.

To extend this example, say that we want to react only to _the first 3 rows of the spreadsheet_, or to rows where the last name is `Wick` (you've seen what he can do when he is upset).

For this, our logic would look something like this:

1. `Has Access?` = `Yes` **and** `Row Number` < 4

**or**

2. `Has Access?` = `Yes` **and** `Last Name` = `Wick`

Considering that our data looks like this:

![google-sheets-data](https://img.enkipro.com/9633e64a27dfc89a5f0e4f588d51b81d.png)

And if we set our filter as discussed above:

![filter-fields](https://img.enkipro.com/dc9727ca46844f5f914355b92455b67b.png)

Notice how only `AND` can be linked (e.g. `check 1 AND check 2 AND ...`), with this sequence not being possible `check 1 OR (check 2 AND check 3)`.

Your zap is now ready, and you will only be notified if the data passes the checks.

## Practice

The limit of checks a filter can have in Zapier is ???.

* none
* 2
* 4
* 6

## Revision

Is this type of check possible with `Filter by Zapier`?

```plain-text
check 1
OR
(check 1 AND check 2)
```

???

* No.
* Yes.
