# What Is the Task History?


---

## Content

Although the zaps that we have shown you didn't seem to encounter any problems (in part because we didn't test them 🤭), that is not always the case. For example, the data you receive might not fit your filter, or you might not receive any data at all.

The **task history** view in Zapier is a debugging tool useful in such scenarios, but not limited to. 

It provides a list of all the tasks that have ever been performed in your Zapier account. The list has its own panel called [Task History](https://zapier.com/app/history) which looks something like this:

Another way of accessing the task history when editing a zap is by clicking the clock button on the right-hand side of the screen (above the cogwheel representing Setting)
