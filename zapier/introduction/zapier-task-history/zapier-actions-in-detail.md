# Task History Advanced


---

## Content

Looking over items in the task history is undoubtedly useful. Another useful extension of this view is the **detailed view** of each task run.

If you click on any of the actions seen in the history, a new detailed page will be opened. In here, you will see all the actions that were performed by your zap, with each having a more detailed view. 

Let's say we have added a new record to our spreadsheet that has `Wick` in the `Last Name` column. Here is what you will find in the task history:

From top to bottom we can see that Zapier noticed a change in the spreadsheet, verifying that said changed passed our constraints and sent a message to slack.

Continuing, we see that we create a new column, verify that the `Has Access?` column says `Yes`, and update the `# of days` column to 7.

Although the zap is working, we have already found some problems:

1. We are checking twice that the `Has Access?` column says `Yes`
2. For every successful zap, we create a new `# of days` column

It is good practice to check your zaps because you never know how you can improve your workflow even further.
