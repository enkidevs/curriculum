# Filtering Task History


---

## Content

No matter the number of zaps you work with, at some point you will find your task history filled with records. Manually looking through countless runs is unfeasible and filtering is required.

All the magic happens at the top of the list:

Start from left to right, we will now explain what each option does:

- the select button
  - you can individually select an action or select multiple actions
  - when selected, you can play, delete, or download them
  - useful for retrying a certain action
- the zap specifier
  - in the picture you can see the `All Zaps` button
  - using this, you can specify which zaps you are interested in
  - this is where renaming zaps comes in useful
- the status specifier
  - in the picture, you can see the `Everything` button; this specifies which statuses you are interested in
  - use this to find out which actions threw an error or which are still waiting
- the date specifier
  - choose a date as a constraint

Lastly, you've got the refresh button (meant to help with seeing the most recent runs in task history), and the `Clear Filters` button.

These features should provide you with a straightforward debugging experience.
