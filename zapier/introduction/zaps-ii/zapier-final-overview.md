To end this mission let's have a look at the full zap:

Step by step, this is what what happens:
1. Monitor Important Data
    - monitor a spreadsheet for any changes
2. Only continue if...
    - the `Has Access` column contains `Yes`
3. Send Direct Message in Slack
    - you will receive a direct message that says `<First Name> <Last Name> has gained access to your base!`
4. Create Spreadsheet Column in Google Sheets
    - Zapier will add a new column with the title `# of days` after the rightmost column
5. Lookup Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets
    - Zapier checks that the `Has Access?` column contains `Yes`
6. Update Spreadsheet Row in Google Sheets
    - Zapier updates the corresponding cell in the `# of days` column to `7` 

In the `Task History` mission we will discuss what problems this zap has and how you can improve it.
