# Update Dynamically 2

---
## Content

In this case, you want to set the step such that every time the zap runs:
- if you have access to the base (the search step)
  - meaning that if the value found in the `Has Access` column is `Yes`
- your number of access days will be updated to 7 (the update step)
  - the corresponding cell in the `# of days` column will be updated to `7`

Create the search step first as this needs to be completed before the update.

As you can see, all it needs to do is look in the `Has Access` column for a `Yes` value. If that is correct, it can go ahead and update the corresponding cell:

Because of how to search step was created (starting from the update step), the `Row` and `Custom Value for Row ID` fields are already completed. All that is left to do is set the `# of days` to `7` (or any other number that you wish).
