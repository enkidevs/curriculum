# Some Integrations


---

## Content

Intuitively, for any zap, you'll need to figure out which apps will be connected. Let's say that your stack includes **Mailchimp**, **Trello** and **Typeform**.

Begin by going to the [Explore page](https://zapier.com/apps/integrations/), typing in the names and selecting them. This will give you a good starting point. If no results show up, don't worry. You can always create your own zaps from scratch.

For this insight, let's go ahead and select our entire stack:

Depending on your application, you can either:

- find your perfect integration
- start using a template and adapt it to your requirements
- create your own zap from scratch.
