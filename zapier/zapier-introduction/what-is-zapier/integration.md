# Integration


---

## Content

As we previously mentioned, you can use Zapier to connect many popular applications, with logic as complex as necessary.

Other than the popular applications that you already know, Zapier provides integration possibilities for more than 1500 applications. And in the small chance that your app is not included, you can still find a way to integrate it (possibly using another application as a bridge).

Here are a few examples of what you can do:

1. Get email notifications for new Google Forms responses
2. Collect new TypeForm responses as rows in a Google Sheet
3. Post upcoming Google Calendar events to a Slack channel

These are only simple examples that connect two applications, but Zapier is not limited to that.

Some features include:

- hooking up multiple applications
- reading, writing & updating data
- setting filters for data
- manipulating data between integration steps
- debugging using task history & stops
- lots of others...
