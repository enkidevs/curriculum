# Zapier Common Terminology


---

## Content

Now, let's introduce some of the terms that you'll see. Here is a list to help you get started[1].

### Zap

- this refers to the automated workflow that connects apps and services
- think of a zap as your entire integration
- a zap is made out of tasks
- e.g. we have previously mentioned that you can get email notification for each Google form completion. This is a zap.

### Trigger

- this represents an event that starts a zap
- in the example, the trigger would be the submittal of the Google form

### Action

- this represents an event that will be performed by Zapier after a trigger
- going back to the example, the action is getting the email notification

### Task

- this is more a general term that refers to any single piece of data that passes through a zap
- in the example, submitting a form **or** receiving an email notification are both tasks
- if your zap sends 5 emails, then it has performed 5 tasks
- as you have already noticed, both triggers and actions can be tasks

Now, you are ready to create your first zap.
