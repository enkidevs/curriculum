# Zapier Dependencies


---

## Content

With so many features and possibilities you'd think that Zapier requires many dependencies or a complicated install process. However, using Zapier is as easy as creating an account.

To create your account, head to the [Zapier's official registration website](https://zapier.com/sign-up/). You can do this through either Google, Facebook or plain email. That's it, you're now ready to use Zapier.

The free version of Zapier is very useful for getting used to the tool and creating some personal integrations, but has its limitations:

- 5 zaps **in total**
- a total of 100 tasks per month
- zaps are limited to single-step (meaning that you can only have one trigger and one action)

Zapier provides many other premium plans that are tailored to your application. To find out more, you can check out the [Official Plans & Pricing](https://zapier.com/pricing) section of their website.
