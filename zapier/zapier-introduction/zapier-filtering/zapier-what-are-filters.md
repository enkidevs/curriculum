# What Are Filters?


---

## Content

Filters represent a very important part of Zapier because they allow you to control which data goes forward in the flow. Basically, if the received information does not fit a certain check (defined by you), then the flow won't continue.

A filter in Zapier is represented by a built-in app called `Filter by Zapier`. To add filters to your zap, you have to add a new step and choose `Filter by Zapier` as your app.

We have briefly used a filter in the past to check whether a column in our spreadsheet had a certain value or not. Keep in mind that filters are not limited to one check per step.

Going back to the zap we have created, for step 2 (the filter step), let's see where we could add another check. After clicking on the step card, go to the `Filter Setup & Testing` section. It should look something like this:

In the following insights we'll learn how to add more checks, their types, and how powerful they are.
