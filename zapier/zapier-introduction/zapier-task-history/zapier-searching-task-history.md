# History of a Single Task


---

## Content

The task history shows records from all zaps, which can become a big list in time. You can filter these records (more details on this concept will be presented in the following insight), or you can open the task history for a single zap.

One of the first steps you should take, before even opening the `Task History` page, is giving your zaps a name (preferably a unique one). This can be done:

- either in the zap editor (just click on the name)

- from your dashboard (by clicking on the small arrow)

Notice that when looking at zaps from your dashboard, you have the option to show the task history only for that zap, which might help you out in the beginning.

In the following insight, we'll take a look at all the possible filtering you can do in the task history.
