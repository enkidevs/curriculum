# Step Names


---

## Content

When working with big zaps, or when you have an entire team working on the same zap, steps can get quite confusing when left with their default names.

Fortunately, Zapier allows you to change the name of your step, and here is how you do it:

All you have to do is click on the `...` in the top right corner of the step card, press `Rename...`, and write the new name.

In our case, we will change the Google Sheets step to `Monitor Important Data`.

On top of this, you can also add a description and a timezone (so that all time related tasks are done relative to specified timezone). This is done by clicking on the cogwheel icon and filling the required fields.
